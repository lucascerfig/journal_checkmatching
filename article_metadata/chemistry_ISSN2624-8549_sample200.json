        "abstract": "<jats:p>Mixed-valence complexes contain two metals with different formal oxidation numbers and, therefore, show mixed properties that are influenced by the electronic coupling between the two metals, which is, in turn, regulated by a bridging ligand. This is an attractive point for many researchers. Oxalate is widely used as a bridging ligand for preparing polynuclear complexes. More than 1000 complexes have been reported until now. However, dithiooxamidate, which is an oxalate analog, is less popular as a bridging ligand. Here, a new dithiooxamidate-bridged Ni-diphosphine dinuclear complex with the formula [(\u03bc2-toxa){Ni(dppe)}2](BF4)2 (toxa = dithiooxamidate; dppe = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) was prepared and characterized via single-crystal X-ray diffraction. When using 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp) instead of dppe, dinuclear, trinuclear, and tetranuclear complexes were obtained, i.e., [(\u03bc2-toxa){Ni(dppp)}2](BF4)2, [{\u03bc2-Ni(toxa)2}{Ni(dppp)}2](BF4)2, and [{\u03bc3-Ni(toxa)3}{Ni(dppp)}3](BF4)2, respectively. Bidentate toxa ligands in dinuclear complexes coordinate each Ni atom as \u03ba(S,N). However, the trinuclear and the tetranuclear complexes have the toxa ligands with \u03ba(N,N) and \u03ba(S,S) coordination. The [(\u03bc2-toxa){Ni(dppe)}2](BF4)2 complex undergoes four reversible redox processes, whose analysis via a controlled-potential absorption spectrum reveals the presence of a Ni(II)-Ni(I) mixed-valence state at \u2206E1/2 = 0.22 V with a comproportionation constant of 6.1 \u00d7 103.</jats:p>",

Their molecules can be viewed as acylphloroglucinol monoterpene or sesquiterpene adducts, with the former having greater activity than the latter. The acylphloroglucinol moiety contains two mutually meta acyl (R\u2013C=O) groups, respectively, in ortho and meta positions with respect to the two C atoms shared by the two moieties. The current work focuses on euglobal molecules in which R = H is in one acyl group and R = isobutyl is in the other. It aims to identify the property differences between molecules having the same terpene moiety and the two acyl groups in reversed positions. Ten such pairs were studied computationally using different levels of theory (HF, DFT, and MP2). The results highlight considerable differences between the two molecules of each pair, regarding molecular features such as relative energies, characteristics of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IHBs), dipole moment, bond vibrational frequencies, and frequency changes caused by the IHBs. A comparison of the results from the different levels of theory utilised shows similar patterns for the influence of position reversal on the same characteristic.</jats:p>",

The crystal packing of centrosymmetric rac-1 is denser than that of its enantiopure counterpart (R)-1.

Phosphotungstic acid (PTA) was chosen as the solid acid catalyst for the transformation, which was heterogenized on humin-derived activated carbon (HAC) for superior recyclability. Using HAC as catalyst support expands the scope of valorizing humin, a complex furanic resin produced inevitably as a side product (often considered waste) during the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis/dehydration of sugars and polymeric carbohydrates. Under optimized conditions (150 \u00b0C, 7 h, 25 wt.% of 20%PTA/HAC-600 catalyst), ethyl levulinate (EL) was obtained in an 85% isolated yield starting from FAL. Using the general synthetic protocol, EL was isolated in 88% and 84% yields from LA and \u03b1-AGL, respectively. The 20%PTA/HAC-600 catalyst was successfully recovered from the reaction mixture and recycled for five cycles. A marginal loss in the yield of ALs was observed in consecutive catalytic cycles due to partial leaching of PTA from the HAC support.</jats:p>",

The rate coefficients of 8\u2013280 \u00d7 107 M\u22121 s\u22121 in acetonitrile revealed a very high reactivity of the cyclobutane dimers of N,N\u2019-dimethylated uracil (DMU), thymine (DMT), and 6-methyluracil (DMU6-Me) towards NO3\u2022, which likely proceeds via ET at N(1) as a major pathway. The overall rate of NO3\u2022 consumption was determined by (i) the redox potential, which was lower for the syn- than for the anti-configured dimers, and (ii) the accessibility of the reaction site for NO3\u2022. In the trans dimers, both N(1) atoms could be approached from above and below the molecular plane, whereas in the cis dimers, only the convex side was readily accessible for NO3\u2022. The higher reactivity of the DMT dimers compared with isomeric DMU dimers was due to the electron-donating methyl groups on the cyclobutane ring, which increased their susceptibility to oxidation. On the other hand, the approach of NO3\u2022 to the dimers of DMU6-Me was hindered by the methyl substituents adjacent to N(1), making these dimers the least reactive in this series.</jats:p>",

However, FAOR on Pt-based catalysts follows a dual pathway mechanism, in which the direct pathway is a preferred route due to its efficient dehydrogenation process. Conversely, the indirect pathway results in the generation of adsorbed CO species, a process that deleteriously poisons the active sites of the catalyst, with CO species only being oxidizable at higher potentials, causing a significant compromise in catalyst performance. Herein, we have successfully synthesized Pt-C3N4@CNT, where three Pt clusters are precisely dispersed in a triplet form within the C3N4 by virtue of the unique structure of C3N4. The mass activity for the direct pathway (0.44 V) delivered a current density of 1.91 A mgPt\u22121, while the indirect pathway (0.86 V) had no obvious oxidation peak. The selectivity of Pt-C3N4@CNT catalysts for the direct pathway of FAOR was improved due to the special structure of C3N4, which facilitates the dispersion of Pt tri-atoms in the structure and the electronic interaction with Pt.

It was found that tungsten has a weak effect on the VOx cluster size distribution through contraction of dilution effect. In contrast, the optimal interaction between W and V, when both reach their highest composition, appears to be a relevant parameter that can enhance their acidic properties and improve the catalytic efficiency in dry conditions. On the other hand, an absence of significant interaction leads to discontinuity due to deactivation. In the presence of steam, acidic properties are averaged, lowering the impact of the V to W ratio. Finally, the critical importance of acidic properties which outperform redox properties in the definition of active site is pointed out in the light of this study.</jats:p>",

Using the Burgio-equation, the required energy is determinable; the energy released during a single impact of a milling ball (Eb), as well as during the whole milling process (Ecum). The aim of this work was the one-step production of BaTiO3 from BaO and TiO2 starting materials. Whereas during mechanochemical reactions it is possible to produce nanoparticles of up to 10 nm, the essence of this study is to develop the preparation of BaTiO3 with a perovskite structure even without subsequent heat treatment, since sintering at high temperatures is associated with a rapid increase in the size of the particles. By describing the synthesis parameters and their energy values (Eb and Ecum), it is possible to transpose experimental conditions, so that in the case of other types of planetary ball mills or grinding vessel made of other materials, the results can be used.

Chemical bonding features are thoroughly analyzed for these two isomers (1a and 1n) with different bonding and topological quantum chemical tools, such as adaptive natural density partitioning (AdNDP), Wiberg Bond Indices (WBIs), nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS), and atoms in molecules (AIM) analyses.

The central allenic carbon atom of isomers 1a and 1n exhibits tri-coordination and thus makes it a case of five bonds to carbon, which is confirmed through their total bond order as observed in WBI. Both the isomers show \u03c3- and \u03c0-aromaticity and are predicted with the NICS and AdNDP analyses.

In this study, we show that the heat treatment of the catalyst precursor can be used to steer the location of the Pd precursor with respect to the acid sites in SAPO-11 and ZSM-22 zeotype materials when ions are exchanged with Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2. Two sets of catalysts were prepared based on composite materials of alumina with either SAPO-11 or ZSM-22. Pd was placed on/in the zeotype, followed by a calcination-reduction (CR) or direct reduction (DR) treatment. Furthermore, catalysts with Pd on the alumina binder were prepared. CR results in having more Pd nanoparticles inside the zeotype crystals, whereas DR yields more particles on the outer surface of the zeotype crystals as is confirmed using HAADF-STEM and XPS measurements. The catalytic performance in both n-heptane and n-hexadecane hydroconversion of the catalysts shows that having the Pd nanoparticles on the alumina binder is most beneficial for maximizing the isomer yields. Pd-on-zeotype catalysts prepared using the DR approach show intermediate performances, outperforming their Pd-in-zeotype counterparts that were prepared with the CR approach.</jats:p>",

Among them, G-quadruplexes are widely used as the key structure elements of DNAzymes to activate the catalytic competency of specific cofactors, such as hemin, but there is a great demand to diversify DNAzymes using other more straightforward DNA structures such as fully matched duplex (FM-DNA). However, the perfect base pairs in duplex limit the DNAzyme activity. In this work, a photocatalytic DNAzyme was developed by introducing an abasic site (AP site) into duplex (AP-DNA) to switch its photocatalytic activity. Palmatine (PAL), a photosensitizer from natural isoquinoline alkaloids, served as a cofactor of the DNAzyme by binding at the AP site. The AP site provides a less polarized environment to favor the PAL fluorescence. As a result, dissolved oxygen was converted into singlet oxygen (1O2) via energy transfer from the excited PAL. The oxidation of substrates by the in situ photogenerated 1O2 served as a readout for the DNAzyme. In addition, the duplex-based DNAzyme was engineered from FM-DNA by the cascade uracil-DNA glycosylase to generate AP-DNA. Our work provides a new way to construct duplex-based DNAzymes.</jats:p>",

However, most of the developed small- to medium-sized hMcl-1 inhibitors have typical off-target activity towards other members of the Bcl-2 family. To improve the hMcl-1 inhibitor design, especially exploring a suitable scaffold with pharmacophoric features, we focused on natural hMcl-1 inhibitors. To date, seven classes of natural compounds have been isolated, which display a low micromolar affinity for hMcl-1 and have limited biophysical studies. We screened hMcl-1 co-crystal structures, and identified nine co-crystal structures of hMcl-1 protein, which were later evaluated by multiple receptor conformations (which indicates that the differences between hMcl-1 in crystal structures are low (RMSD values between 0.52 and 1.13 \u00c5, average RMSD of 0.638\u20130.888 \u212b, with a standard deviation of 0.102\u20130.185\u212b)), and multiple ligand conformations (which led to the selection of the PDB structure, 3WIX (RMSD value = 0.879 \u212b, standard deviation 0.116 \u212b), to accommodate various Mcl-1 ligands from a range of co-crystal PDB files) methods.

Taking advantage of the high selectivity and generalizability of DNAzymes, we report herein DNAzyme-based ratiometric sensors for Zn2+ based on BRET. The 8-17 DNAzyme was labeled with luciferase and Cy3. The proximity between luciferase and Cy3 permitted BRET when coelenterazine, the substrate for luciferase, was introduced. Adding samples containing Zn2+ resulted in a cleavage of the substrate strand, causing dehybridization of the DNAzyme construct, thus increasing the distance between Cy3 and luciferase and changing the BRET signals. Using these sensors, we detected Zn2+ in serum samples and achieved Zn2+ detection with a smartphone camera. Moreover, since the BRET pair is not the component that determines the selectivity of the sensors, this sensing platform has the potential to be adapted for the detection of other metal ions with other metal-dependent DNAzymes.</jats:p>",

Ru3+ (3 or 10 mol%) precursor was added to UiO-66 synthesis and, subsequently, the as-synthesized hybrid structure was calcined in flowing air at different temperatures (400\u2013600 \u00b0C) to obtain ZrO2-derived oxides doped with highly dispersed Ru metallic clusters. The materials were tested for the catalytic photo-thermal conversion of CO2 to CH4. Methanation experiments were conducted in a continuous flow (feed flow rate of 5 sccm and 1:4 CO2 to H2 molar ratio) reactor at temperatures from 80 to 300 \u00b0C. Ru0.10@ZrO2 catalyst calcined at 600 \u00b0C was able to hydrogenate CO2 to CH4 with production rates up to 65 mmolCH4\u00b7gcat.\u20131\u00b7h\u20131, CH4 yield of 80% and nearly 100% selectivity at 300 \u00b0C. The effect of the illumination was investigated with this catalyst using a high-power visible LED. A CO2 conversion enhancement from 18% to 38% was measured when 24 sun of visible LED radiation was applied, mainly due to the increase in the temperature as a result of the efficient absorption of the radiation received. MOF-derived Ru@ZrO2 catalysts have resulted to be noticeably active materials for the photo-thermal hydrogenation of CO2 for the purpose of the production of carbon-neutral methane. A remarkable effect of the ZrO2 crystalline phase on the CH4 selectivity has been found, with monoclinic zirconia being much more selective to CH4 than its cubic allotrope.</jats:p>",

The marine odor is characterized by the specific smell of sea breeze, seashore, algae, and oyster, among others. Marine odor is a more recent fragrance and is considered as one of the green and modern fragrances. The smells reproducing the marine environment are described due to their content of Calone 1951 (7-methyl-2H-1,5-benzodioxepin-3(4H)-one), which is a synthetic compound. In addition to the synthetic group of benzodioxepanes, such as Calone 51 and its derivatives, three other groups of chemical compounds seem to represent the marine smell. The first group includes the polyunsaturated cyclic ((+)-Dictyopterene A) and acyclic (giffordene) hydrocarbons, acting as pheromones. The second group corresponds to polyunsaturated aldehydes, such as the (Z,Z)-3,6-nonadienal, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, which are most likely derived from the degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The third group is represented by small molecules such as sulfur compounds and halogenated phenols which are regarded as the main flavor compounds of many types of seafood. This review exposes, most notably, the knowledge state on the occurrence of marine ingredients in fragrance. We also provide a detailed discussion on several aspects of essential oils, which are the most natural ingredients from various marine sources used in fragrance and cosmetics, including synthetic and natural marine ingredients.</jats:p>",

Alternatively, dissolution and downstream chemistry of RE2O3 have been achieved with ionic liquids (ILs), but typically with additional water. In contrast, the anhydrous IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [BMIm][OAc] dissolves RE2O3 for RE = La\u2013Ho and forms homoleptic dinuclear metal complexes that crystallize as [BMIm]2[RE2(OAc)8] salts. Chloride ions promote the dissolution without being included in the compounds. Since the lattice energy of RE2O3 increases with decreasing size of the RE3+ cation, Ho2O3 dissolves very slowly, while the sesquioxides with even smaller cations appear to be inert under the applied conditions. The Sm and Eu complex salts show blue and red photoluminescence and Van Vleck paramagnetism. The proton source for the dissolution is the imidazolium cation. Abstraction of the acidic proton at the C2-atom yields an N-heterocyclic carbene (imidazole-2-ylidene). The IL can be regenerated by subsequent reaction with acetic acid.

The mechanical properties of the composites were determined by tensile and impact tests. Morphological analysis was later performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). According to the experiment results, the tensile and impact strength of both wood and palmyra fibers increase after silane treatment. However, for the low-wood-fiber-content composite, the tensile and impact strength decrease after silane treatment due to the presence of an excess amount of silane relative to fiber content. The addition of wood and palmyra fibers significantly improved the tensile modulus of composite material and further increases slightly after silane treatment. Finally, SEM analysis shows a homogenous mix of fibers and polymer matrices with fewer voids after silane treatment, thereby improving interfacial adhesion.</jats:p>",

This review analyzes the available characterization data and evaluates the changes in molecular weight, crystallinity, chemical structure, and mechanical properties of PAs that have aged in oxygen-free water at high temperatures. The molecular weight and mechanical strength decrease as the crystallinity ratio rises over aging time. This development is occurring at a slower rate than degradation in pure thermal oxidation. By combining the data for the changes in mechanical properties with the ones for molecular weight and crystallinity, the point of embrittlement can be not only predicted, but also modeled.

The Mindu and Quarenta streams criss-cross the urban area of Manaus and receive domestic effluents from many heavily populated districts. In addition, the Quarenta stream is subjected to effluents from the industrial district of Manaus. The Tarum\u00e3-A\u00e7u stream is mostly covered by vegetation, although the region presents some occurrence of family farming, floating petrol station, marinas, and floating restaurants and bars. n-Alkanes were determined by Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID), whereas hopanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined by Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The metals Ag, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) after microwave-assisted acid digestion. Concentrations of total PAHs and metals were higher in sediments from the urban streams Mindu and Quarenta because of the occurrence of more intense and diverse sources of pollution. In addition, some sediment samples from both these streams presented concentrations of fluoranthene, phenanthrene, and metals higher than the limits of low probability of adverse effects on biota established by the international guideline and by the Brazilian legislation. A similar total n-alkane concentration for sediments from all streams associated with profiles of n-alkanes with no odd/even hydrocarbon predominance suggests that biomass burning is an important source of hydrocarbons. Petroleum-derived products also represented a source for n-alkanes, as confirmed by the presence of \u03b1,\u03b2-hopanes, including an \u03b1,\u03b2-homohopane series from C31 to C35 with the presence of both 22S and 22R epimers.

The synthesis of biominerals and organization at the macroscopic level is a consequence of the interactions of these materials with proteins. The association of biominerals and proteins is very ancient and has sparked a wealth of research across biological, medical and material sciences. Calcium carbonate, hydroxyapatite, and silica represent widespread natural biominerals. The atomic details of the interface between macromolecules and these biominerals is very intriguing from a chemical perspective, considering the association of chemical entities that are structurally different. With this review I provide an overview of the available structural studies of biomineralization proteins, explored from the Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) archive and scientific literature, and of how these studies are inspiring the design and engineering of proteins able to synthesize novel biominerals. The progression of this review from classical template proteins to silica polymerization seeks to benefit researchers involved in various interdisciplinary aspects of a biomineralization project, who need background information and a quick update on advances in the field. Lessons learned from structural studies are exemplary and will guide new projects for the imaging of new hybrid biomineral/protein superstructures at the atomic level.</jats:p>",

All prepared compounds were characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR spectroscopy, TGA/DTA, and single crystal X-ray analysis. The impact of anions (acetate, perchlorate) and solvent used on the dimensionality of cadmium(II) complexes and the cadmium(II) coordination environment was investigated. The bridging capabilities of acetate ions enabled the formation of dimers in the crystal structure of 1. It was shown that the dimensionality of perchlorate complexes depends on the solvent used. The coordination polymer 2 is isolated from an ethanol solution, while monomeric compound 3 was obtained by using a water/ethanol mixture as a solvent. The pentagonal-bipyramidal coordination of cadmium(II) was found in the presence of chelating and bridging acetate ions in 1. In the presence of non-coordinating perchlorate anions in 2 and 3, the coordination geometry of cadmium(II) is found to be octahedral. The supramolecular amide-amide homosynthon R22(8) was preserved in the hydrogen-bonded frameworks of all three compounds.</jats:p>",

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme that catalyzes in vivo redox reactions between H2O2 and Cl\u2212 to produce HClO. Abnormal levels of HClO and MPO may lead to oxidative stress, irreversible tissue damage and, thus, serious diseases; they are thus becoming important biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this work, using HClO-induced site-specific cleavage of phosphorothioate-modified DNA to trigger rolling circle amplification (RCA), RCA-assisted biosensors have been developed for the highly sensitive and specific detection of HClO and MPO. Only two DNA oligonucleotides are used in the sensing systems. The powerful signal-amplification capability of RCA endows the sensing systems with a high sensitivity, and the specific fluorescent response of thioflavin T (ThT) to G-quadruplexes in RCA products makes a label-free signal output possible. The proposed biosensors were demonstrated to work well not only for the sensitive and specific quantitation of HClO and MPO with detection limits of 1.67 nM and 0.33 ng/mL, respectively, but also for the screening and inhibitory capacity evaluation of MPO inhibitors, thus holding great promise in disease diagnosis and drug analysis.</jats:p>",

Today, new zeolite deposits continue to be discovered in the country. This work aims to present the results of a study carried out in an unexplored area that is located approximately 1.2 km east of the Loma Blanca deposit, outside the mining operation limits. To carry out this research and to establish a qualitative comparison between both sample populations, four samples were taken from the study area, and another four were taken from the Loma Blanca deposit. The characterisation of the samples was performed by XRD, SEM, and XRF. The pozzolan quality was determined by the pozzolanicity test (PT) and quality chemical analysis (QCA). Finally, a study of the mechanical strength (MST) was performed at 7, 28, and 90 days, using mortar specimens made with PC/ZT: 75\u201325% and PC/ZT: 70\u201330%, respectively. The results of the studies using XRD, SEM, and XRF indicated that both groups of samples had a similar complex mineralogical composition, consisting mainly of mordenite and clinoptilolite accompanied by secondary phases such as quartz and amorphous materials in the form of altered glass. The pozzolanicity test showed that both the samples from the study area and those from the Loma Blanca deposit behaved like typical pozzolans, which is a trend that can be seen in the high values of mechanical strength to compression up to 72 MPa for the PC/ZT: 75\u201325% formulation and 66 MPa for the PC/ZT: 70\u201330%. The results obtained establish that the zeolite varieties detected in the study area are similar to those of the Loma Blanca deposit, which could have a positive impact on the increase in current reserves, especially for manufacturing pozzolanic cements with properties that contribute to the preservation of the environment.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Resource shortage is a major problem in our world. Nuclear energy is a green energy and because of this and its high energy density, it has been attracting more and more attention during the last few decades. Uranium is a valuable nuclear fuel used in the majority of nuclear power plants. More than one thousand times more uranium exists in the oceans, at very low concentrations, than is present in terrestrial ores. As the demand for nuclear power generation increases year-on-year, access to this reserve is of paramount importance for energy security. Water-insoluble polymeric materials functionalized with the amidoxime group are a technically feasible platform for extracting uranium, in the form of {UO2}2+, from seawater, which also contains various concentrations of other competing metal ions, including vanadium (V). An in-depth understanding of the coordination modes and binding strength of the amidoxime group with uranyl and other competing ions is a key parameter for improving extraction efficiency and selectivity. Very limited information on the complexation of {UO2}2+ with amidoximes was available before 2012. However, significant advances have been made during the last decade. This report reviews the solid-state coordination chemistry of the amidoxime group (alone or within ligands with other potential donor sites) with the uranyl ion, while sporadic attention on solution and theoretical studies is also given. Comparative studies with vanadium complexation are also briefly described. Eight different coordination modes of the neutral and singly deprotonated amidoxime groups have been identified in the structures of the uranyl complexes. Particular emphasis is given to describing the reactivity of the open-chain glutardiamidoxime, closed-ring glutarimidedioxime and closed-ring glutarimidoxioxime moieties, which are present as side chains on the sorbents, towards the uranyl moiety. The technological implications of some of the observed coordination modes are outlined. It is believed that X-ray crystallography of small uranyl-amidoxime molecules may help to build an understanding of the interactions of seawater uranyl with amidoxime-functionalized polymers and improve their recovery capacity and selectivity, leading to more efficient extractants. The challenges for scientists working on the structural elucidation of uranyl coordination complexes are also outlined. The review contains six sections and 95 references.</jats:p>",

These Cu(I) complexes were prepared indirectly from the ligands and CuBr2 via an in situ redox process in moderate to high yields. Four of the pyrazine ligands, 1, 4\u20136 were found to favor a monodentate mode of coordination to one CuI ion. The absence of a C6-chloro substituent in ligands 1, 2 and 6 supported N1\u2013Cu coordination over the alternative N4\u2013Cu coordination mode evidenced for ligands 4 and 5. These monodentate systems afforded predominantly hydrogen bond (HB) networks containing a catenated (\u03bc3-bromo)-CuI \u2018staircase\u2019 motif, with a network of \u2018cooperative\u2019 halogen bonds (XB), leading to infinite polymeric structures. Alternatively, ligands 2 and 3 preferred a \u03bc2-N,N\u2019 bridging mode leading to three different polymeric structures. These adopt the (\u03bc3-bromo)-CuI \u2018staircase\u2019 motif observed in the monodentate ligands, a unique single (\u03bc2-bromo)-CuI chain, or a discrete Cu2Br2 rhomboid (\u03bc2-bromo)-CuI dimer.

Experimental data showed that acetonitrile (aprotic polar) could largely hinder the reaction rate, whereas toluene (aprotic apolar) did not. In both cases, product selectivity at isoconversion was not affected. Further insights were obtained by means of neutron diffraction experiments, which confirmed the kinetic data and allowed for the proposal of a model based on substrate\u2013solvent crosstalk by means of hydrogen bonding. In addition, the model was also validated in the ring-opening reaction (overoxidation) of styrene oxide to benzaldehyde, which progressed when toluene was the solvent (reaching 31% styrene oxide conversion) but was strongly hindered when acetonitrile was used instead (reaching only 7% conversion) due to the establishment of H-bonds in the latter. Although this model was confirmed and validated for olefin oxidation reactions, it can be envisaged that it may also be applied to other catalytic reaction systems where reaction control is critical, thereby widening its use.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Chemical processes mostly happen in fluid environments where reaction partners encounter via diffusion. The bimolecular encounters take place at a nanosecond time scale. The chemical environment (e.g., solvent molecules, (counter)ions) has a decisive influence on the reactivity as it determines the contact time between two molecules and affects the energetics. For understanding reactivity at an atomic level and at the appropriate dynamic time scale, it is crucial to combine matching experimental and theoretical data. Here, we have utilized all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations for accessing the key time scale (nanoseconds) using a QM/MM-Hamiltonian. Ion pairs consisting of a radical ion and its counterion are ideal systems to assess the theoretical predictions because they reflect dynamics at an appropriate time scale when studied by temperature-dependent EPR spectroscopy. We have investigated a diketone radical anion with its tetra-ethylammonium counterion. We have established a funnel-like transition path connecting two (equivalent) complexation sites. The agreement between the molecular-dynamics simulation and the experimental data presents a new paradigm for ion\u2013ion interactions. This study exemplarily demonstrates the impact of the molecular environment on the topological states of reaction intermediates and how these states can be consistently elucidated through the combination of theory and experiment.

Many achievements were made using biomolecules to improve the quality of the messages in communication. At the same time, it is still a challenge to construct cooperative communications based on the interactions between biomolecules to achieve the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted messages. DNA-based encrypted communications have been developed, and in particular, DNA-origami-based message encryption can combine steganography and pattern encryption and exhibits extremely high confidentiality. Nevertheless, limited by biological characteristics, encrypted messages based on DNA require a strict storage environment in the process of transmission. The integrity of the message encoded in the DNA may be damaged when the DNA is in an unfriendly and hard environment. Therefore, it is particularly significant to improve the stability of DNA when it is exposed to a harsh environment during transmission. Here, we encoded the information into the DNA strands that were condensed for encryption to form a nanosphere covered with a shell of SiO2, which brings high-density messages and exhibits higher stability than separated DNA. The solid shell of SiO2 could prevent DNA from contacting the harsh environment, thereby protecting the DNA structure and maintaining the integrity of the information. At the same time, DNA nanospheres can achieve high throughput input and higher storage density per unit volume, which contribute to confusing the message strand (M-strand) with the interference strand in the stored information. Condensing DNA into the nanosphere that is used for DNA origami cryptography has the potential to be used in harsh conditions with higher confidentiality and integrity for the transmitted messages.</jats:p>",

Their development has been boosted recently by the introduction of nonfullerene electron acceptors (NFAs), to be used in combination with a polymeric electron donor in the active layer composition. Many of the recent advances in NFAs are attributable to the class of fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), which is now predominant, with one of the most notable examples being formed with a fused five-member-ring indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b\u2032]dithiophene (IDT) core. Here, we propose a novel and more sustainable synthesis for the IDT core. Our approach bypasses tin derivatives needed in the Stille condensation, whose byproducts are toxic and difficult to dispose of, and it makes use of cascade reactions, effectively reducing the number of synthetic steps.</jats:p>",

In this study, jute fiber-reinforced composites previously manufactured from an industrial waste (W), polypropylene, compatibilizer, and nano-calcium carbonate (N), were exposed to natural and accelerated aging. The composites were tested by infrared spectroscopy, contact angle (CA) measurement, and tensile test. Infrared analysis showed greater oxidative degradation after accelerated aging. All CA values continued above 90\u00b0 after natural aging. Among all compositions, the ones with the presence of N had the highest CA values, showing that N acted as a waterproofing agent. After accelerated aging, a significant decrease in all CA values was observed. The composites did not show significant variation in the elastic modulus after either aging. Deformation at break decreased significantly for compositions with no jute fiber in both aging programs. No remarkable reduction was observed in the compositions with jute fibers.</jats:p>",

An improved surface reducibility with smaller crystallite size was noted on hydrazine-treated cobalt species (i.e., Co3O4(H) catalyst), which indicates some surface transformation. This finding correlates with the surface roughness formation (as depicted by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) data), which was further confirmed by an increase in the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area. The mesoporous structure of the Co3O4(H) catalyst remained intact, as compared to that of the Co3O4 catalyst. Interestingly, the in situ treatment of the standalone Co3O4(H) catalyst decreased the maximum CO conversion temperature (T100%) from 160 \u00b0C (over Co3O4) to 100 \u00b0C, with good selectivity. The Co3O4(H) catalyst showed good stability, with approximately 85% CO conversion at 100 \u00b0C for 21 h, as compared to a faster deactivation of the Co3O4 catalyst. However, the Co3O4(H) catalyst was unstable in both CO2 and the moisture environment. Based on the evaluation of spent hydrazine-treated (CoO(H)) cobalt catalyst, the high PROX activity is associated with the formation of Co3+ species as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) data.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Methyl carboxylate esters have been shown to be potent promoters of low-temperature methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether (DME) using various zeolite catalysts. In the present work, catalytic kinetic studies, in-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) techniques were used to elucidate the promotional mechanism of methyl carboxylate esters on methanol dehydration to DME, using the medium pore zeolite H-ZSM-5 (MFI) as the catalyst. Kinetic studies were performed using the very potent methyl n-hexanoate promoter. The DME yield was dependent on both the methanol and methyl n-hexanoate partial pressures across the temperature ranges used in this study (110 to 130 \u00b0C). This is consistent with the promoted reaction being a bimolecular reaction between methanol and ester species adsorbed at the catalyst active sites, via an SN2 type reaction, as previously postulated. The in-situ FT-IR studies reveal that the Br\u00f8nsted acid (BA) sites on H-ZSM-5 were very rapidly titrated by ester carbonyl group adsorption and bonded more strongly with esters than with methanol. Upon methanol addition, an even lower DME formation temperature (30 \u00b0C) was observed with methyl n-hexanoate pretreated H-ZSM-5 samples in the in-situ NMR studies, further confirming the strong promotion of this methyl ester on methanol dehydration to DME. The adsorption and reactivity of different methyl esters on H-ZSM-5 indicates that while methyl formate more easily dissociates into a surface methoxy species, [Si(OMe)Al], and carboxylic acid, it is a less potent promoter than alkyl-chain-containing methyl esters in methanol dehydration to DME, which in turn did not show this dissociative behavior in the low-temperature NMR studies. This indicates that methyl alkyl carboxylates do not need to be dissociated to a surface methoxy species to promote the methanol dehydration reaction and that a bimolecular associative mechanism plays an important role in promoting DME formation.</jats:p>",

In this respect, membrane-supported recovery of organocatalysts represents a particularly useful tool and a valid option for organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis. However, catalyst leaching/degradation and a subsequent decrease in selectivity/conversion are significant drawbacks. As the effectivity of the membrane separation depends mainly on the size of the catalyst in contrast to the other solutes, molecular weight enlargement of small organocatalysts is usually necessary. In the last few years, several synthetic methodologies have been developed to facilitate their recovery by nanofiltration. With the aim of extending the possibilities for the membrane-supported recovery of organocatalysts further, this contribution presents a review of the existing synthetic approaches for the molecular weight enlargement of organocatalysts.</jats:p>",

In the hypercoordination sphere, the element can achieve planar and/or non-planar molecular shape. Hence, planar hypercoordinate carbon species violate two structural rules: (i) The highest coordination number of carbon is four and (ii) the tetrahedral orientation by the connected elements and/or groups. The unusual planar orientations are mostly stabilized by the electronic interactions of the central atom with the surrounding ligands. In this review article, we will talk about the current progress in the theoretical prediction of viable planar hypercoordinate carbon compounds. Primary knowledge of the planar hypercoordinate chemistry will lead to its forthcoming expansion. Experimental and theoretical interests in planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC), planar pentacoordinate carbon (ppC), and planar hexacoordinate carbon (phC) are continued. The proposed electronic and mechanical strategies are helpful for the designing of the ptC compounds. Moreover, the 18-valence electron rule can guide the design of new ptC clusters computationally as well as experimentally. However, the counting of 18-valence electrons is not a requisite condition to contain a ptC in a cluster. Furthermore, this ptC idea is expanded to the probability of a greater coordination number of carbon in planar orientations. Unfortunately, until now, there are no such logical approaches to designing ppC, phC, or higher-coordinate carbon molecules/ions. There exist a few global minimum structures of phC clusters identified computationally, but none have been detected experimentally. All planar hypercoordinate carbon species in the global minima may be feasible in the gas phase.</jats:p>",

One of the critical parameters for their potential use is high efficiency in a wide temperature range, particularly below 0 \u00b0C. This article analyzes the phase equilibria and electrochemical properties of sodium-ion battery electrolytes that are based on NaPF6 solutions in solvent mixtures of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (EC:DEC), dimethyl carbonate (EC:DMC), and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (EC:DME). All studied electrolytes demonstrate a decrease in conductivity at lower temperatures and transition to a quasi-solid state resembling \u201cwet snow\u201d at certain temperatures: EC:DEC at \u22128 \u00b0C, EC:DMC at \u221213 \u00b0C, and EC:DME at \u221221 \u00b0C for 1 M NaPF6 solutions. This phase transition affects their conductivity to a different degree. The impact is minimal in the case of EC:DEC, although it partially freezes at a higher temperature than other electrolytes. The EC:DMC-based electrolyte demonstrates the best efficiency at temperatures down to \u221220 \u00b0C. However, upon further cooling, 1 M NaPF6 in EC:DEC retains a higher conductivity and lower resistivity in symmetrical Na3V2(PO4)3-based cells. The temperature range from \u221220 to \u221240 \u00b0C is characterized by the strongest deterioration in the electrochemical properties of electrolytes: for 1 M NaPF6 in EC:DMC, the charge transfer resistance increased 36 times, and for 1 M NaPF6 in EC:DME, 450 times. For 1 M NaPF6 in EC:DEC, the growth of this parameter is much more modest and amounts to only 1.7 times. This allows us to consider the EC:DEC-based electrolyte as a promising basis for the further development of low-temperature sodium-ion batteries.</jats:p>",

In this work, we synthesize a reactive hydrophobic surfactant monomer, KS-3, from oleic acid, N,N-dimethylpropylenediamine, and allyl chloride. A strong synergistic effect between KS-3 and cocamidopropyl betaine in aqueous solution enhances the hydrophilic dispersibility of KS-3, thereby transforming spherical micelles into cylindrical micelles. KS-3 was grafted onto a polyacrylamide chain via aqueous free-radical polymerization to obtain RES, a hydrophobic association polymer. Structural analysis revealed that the RES polymers assembled in wormlike micelles were more tightly arranged than those assembled in spherical micelles, resulting in a compact network structure in water, smooth surface, and high thermal stability. Rheological tests revealed that the synthesized polymers with wormlike and spherical micelles exhibited shear-thinning properties along with different structural strengths and viscoelasticities. Therefore, controlling the micellar state can effectively regulate the polymer properties. The polymers obtained through wormlike micelle polymerization have potential applications in fields with high demands, such as drug release, water purification, and oilfield development.</jats:p>",

This unique fluorescence enhancement was used to selectively detect the tetracyclines. The purpose of this study was to use graphene oxide (GO) to suppress the background fluorescence for enhanced detection. First, the adsorption of doxycycline on GO was studied. At pH 8.0, 82.7% of doxycycline was adsorbed by GO, and adding 2 \u00b5M aptamer desorbed 55.4% of doxycycline. With GO, the signal increase was comparable from pH 6 to 8, whereas without GO, the increase was significantly lower at pH 8. Under optimized condition, a detection limit of 1.6 nM doxycycline was achieved at pH 8.0 in the presence of GO, whereas without GO, the detection limit was 18.9 nM. This is an interesting example of the use of nanomaterials to enhance the performance of aptamer-based biosensors.</jats:p>",

We have previously designed and synthesized quinoline-3-carboxamides as potential ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase inhibitors to function as an adjuvant treatment with DNA damaging agents. This article discusses the molecular docking studies performed with these derivatives with the DNA damage and response (DDR) kinases-ATM, ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related (ATR), and DNA dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and highlights their selectivity towards ATM kinase. Docking studies were also performed with mTOR and PI3K\u03b3, which are close homologs of the DDR kinases. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for one of the inhibitors against all the enzymes to establish the stability of the interactions involved. Finally, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties of the inhibitors were predicted using the QikProp manual in Maestro. In conclusion, the molecules synthesized showed high selectivity towards the ATM kinase in comparison with the other kinases, though the sequence similarity between them was relatively high.</jats:p>",

Herein, we prepared an array of hydroxyproline-based dipeptides through amide coupling of Boc-protected cis- or trans-4-l-hydroxyproline (cis- or trans-4-Hyp) to benzylated glycine (Gly-OBn) and l-valine (l-Val-OBn) and used these dipeptides as catalysts for a model aldol reaction. Despite the lack of a proton donor in the catalytic site, we observed good stereoselectivities for the R-configured aldol product both with dipeptides formed from cis- or trans-4-Hyp at moderate conversions after 24 h. To explain this conundrum, we modeled reaction cycles for aldol additions in the presence of cis-4-Hyp, trans-4-Hyp, and cis- and trans-configured 4-Hyp-peptides as catalysts by calculation of free energies of conformers of intermediates and transition states at the density functional theory level (B3LYP/6-31G(d), DMSO PCM as solvent model). While a catalytic cycle as previously suggested with l-proline is also plausible for cis- or trans-4-Hyp, with the peptides, the energy barrier of the first reaction step would be too high to allow conversions at room temperature. Calculations on modeled transition states suggest an alternative pathway that would explain the experimental results: here, the catalytic cycle is entered by the acetone self-adduct 4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-one, which forms spontaneously to a small extent in the presence of a base, leading to considerably reduced calculated free energy levels of transition states of reaction steps that are considered rate-determining.</jats:p>",

The confined micellar environment exerts pressure on both precursors and perovskite crystals formed inside, enabling stable phases not typically observed at room temperature in conventional synthesis. This provides access to perovskite structures that are otherwise challenging to produce. The hydrophobic shell of the micelle also enhances perovskite stability, particularly when combined with anionic exchange approaches or large aromatic cations. This synergy results in long-lasting stable optical properties despite environmental exposure. Reverse micelle templates offer a versatile platform for modulating perovskite structure and behavior across a broad spectrum of perovskite compositions, yielding unique phases with diverse emission characteristics.

The presently reported quantum chemical work explores the electronic properties of deprotonated benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene anions functionalized with a single cyano group.

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Encapsulating enzymes in a tailored scaffold is of great potential in industrial enzymatic catalysis, which can enhance the stability of enzymes thus expanding their applications. Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as promising candidates for enzyme encapsulation due to their precise pore structure, ease of synthesis and good biocompatibility. Despite the fact that enzymes encapsulated in MOFs can obtain enhanced stability, there has been little discussion about the thermal stability of enzyme-MOF composites in solid state under extremely high temperatures. Herein, we fabricated the enzyme-MOF composites, CALB-ZIF-8, via a convenient coprecipitation method in aqueous solution, which exhibited good thermal stability at 180 \u00b0C. It was found that the activity of CALB encapsulated in ZIF-8 retained nearly ~80% after heating for 10 min at 180 \u00b0C. A finite element method was applied to investigate the heat transfer process within a ZIF-8 model, indicating that the air filled in cavities of ZIF-8 played a significant role in hindering the heat transfer and this may be an important reason for the outstanding thermal stability of CALB-ZIF-8 at 180 \u00b0C, which paves a new path for expanding the industrial application of enzyme-MOF composites.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel is a well-known contributor to drug-induced cardiotoxicity and therefore is an extremely important target when performing safety assessments of drug candidates. Ligand-based approaches in connection with quantitative structure active relationships (QSAR) analyses have been developed to predict hERG toxicity. The availability of the recent published cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure for the hERG channel opened the prospect of using structure-based simulation and docking approaches for hERG drug liability predictions. In recent times, the idea of combining structure- and ligand-based approaches for modeling hERG drug liability has gained momentum offering improvements in predictability when compared to ligand-based QSAR practices alone. The present article demonstrates uniting the structure-based SILCS (site-identification by ligand competitive saturation) approach in conjunction with physicochemical properties to develop predictive models for hERG blockade. This combination leads to improved model predictability based on Pearson\u2019s R and percent correct (represents rank-ordering of ligands) metric for different validation sets of hERG blockers involving a diverse chemical scaffold and wide range of pIC50 values. The inclusion of the SILCS structure-based approach allows determination of the hERG region to which compounds bind and the contribution of different chemical moieties in the compounds to the blockade, thereby facilitating the rational ligand design to minimize hERG liability.</jats:p>",

The CBD consists of the N1 domain, linker, N2 domain, and latch (N1-N2~) as predicted from the amino acid sequences. The crystal structure of the Cnm/CBD was determined at a 1.81 \u00c5 resolution. N1_linker_N2 forms a ring structure that can enfold collagen molecules, and the latch interacts with N1 to form a ring clasp. N1 and N2 have similar immunoglobulin folds. The collagen-binding activities of Cbm/CBD and its domain variants were examined using ELISA. N1-N2~ bound to collagen with KD = 2.8 \u03bcM, and the latch-deleted variant (N1-N2) showed weaker binding (KD = 28 \u03bcM). The linker-deleted variant (N1N2~) and single-domain variants (N1 and N2) showed no binding activity, whereas the domain-swapped variant (N2-N1~) showed binding ability, indicating that the two N-domains and the linker are important for collagen binding.

Moreover, nisin\u2014a bacteriocin widely used as a natural food preservative\u2014has recently gained much attention due its antimicrobial action against Gram-positive bacteria in biomedical applications. Therefore, the aim of this work was to conjugate biogenic silver nanoparticles (PchNPs) with nisin to obtain nanoconjugates (PchNPs@nis) with enhanced antimicrobial properties. Characterization assays were conducted to determine physicochemical properties of PchNPs@nis, and also their antibacterial and antibiofilm activities were studied. The formation of PchNPs@nis was confirmed by UV-Vis, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy analysis. Different PchNPs@nis nanobioconjugates showed diameter values in the range of 60\u2013130 nm by DLS and surface charge values between \u221220 and \u221213 mV. Nisin showed an excellent affinity to PchNPs, with binding efficiencies higher than 75%. Stable synthesized PchNPs@nis nanobioconjugates were not only able to inhibit biofilm formation by S. aureus, but also showed inhibition of the planktonic cell growth of Staphyloccocus aureus and Escherichia coli, broadening the spectrum of action of the unconjugated antimicrobials against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, these results show the promising application of PchNPs@nis, prepared via green technology, as potential antimicrobial nanomaterials.</jats:p>",

A model is developed for equilibrium swelling of TR gels in binary mixtures of solvents. It takes into account three types of phase transitions in TR gels driven by (i) aggregation of hydrophobic side groups into clusters from which solvent molecules are expelled, (ii) replacement of water with cosolvent molecules in cage-like structures surrounding these groups, and (iii) replacement of water with cosolvent as the main element of hydration shells around backbone chains. The model involves a relatively small number of material constants that are found by matching observations on covalently cross-linked poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) macroscopic gels and microgels. Good agreement is demonstrated between the experimental data and results of numerical analysis. Classification is provided of the phase transition points on equilibrium swelling diagrams.</jats:p>",

It is known that positive electrostatic potential above the central areas of the molecular surface is related to high sensitivity towards the detonation of high-energy molecules. Coordination compounds offer additional structural features that can be used for the adjustment of the electrostatic potential values and sensitivity towards detonation of this class of HEM compounds. By a careful combination of the transition metal atoms and ligands, it is possible to achieve a fine-tuning of the values of the electrostatic potential on the surface of the chelate complexes. Here we combined Density Functional Theory calculations with experimental data to evaluate the high-energy properties of tris(3-nitropentane-2,4-dionato-\u03ba2 O,O\u2032) (nitro-tris(acetylacetonato)) complexes of Cr(III), Mn(III), Fe(III), and Co(III).

Analysis of IR spectra and initiation of the Co(AcAc-NO2)3 complex in the open flame confirmed that these compounds act as high-energy molecules. The measured heat of combustion for the Co(AcAc-NO2)3 complex was 14,133 J/g, which confirms the high-energy properties of this compound.

Here, we present a novel strategy for synthesizing sugar-coated platinum nanostructures (SC-Pt-NS) from the carbohydrates sucrose and D(-)-fructose. In the synthesis from a mixture of H2PtCl6\u00b76H2O, the carbohydrate in an ionic liquid (IL) yielded primary particles of a homogeneous average size of ~10 nm, which were aggregated to hierarchical Pt nanostructures of ~40\u201365 nm and surrounded or supported by the carbohydrate. These sugar-coated platinum nanostructures present a facile way to support and heterogenize nanoparticles, avoid leaching and enable easier separation and handling. The catalytic activity of the SC-Pt-NS was shown in the hydrosilylation test reaction of phenylacetylene with triethylsilane, where very high turnover frequency (TOF) values of up to 87,200 h\u22121 could be achieved, while the platinum metal leaching into the product was very low.</jats:p>",

TPX techniques for catalyst characterization reveal the role of the support on the stabilization and dispersion of the active sites. However, these can be altered at high temperature since sintering of active species can occur as well as possible carbon deposition through the Bosch reaction, which hinders the active species and deactivates the catalyst. In situ characterization of the spent catalyst, however, may expose the causes for catalyst deactivation. For example, a simple TPO analysis on the spent catalyst may produce CO and CO2 via a reaction with O2 at high temperature and this is a strong indication that deactivation may be due to the deposition of carbon during the Sabatier reaction. Other TPX techniques such as TPR and pulse chemisorption are also valuable techniques when they are applied in situ to the fresh catalyst and then to the catalyst upon deactivation.</jats:p>",

The remaining 25 beer samples tested came from so-called microbreweries, which together account for less than 10% of the Croatian market. Fluoride concentrations in light beers ranged from 49 to 180 \u03bcg L\u22121, with a mean value of 95 \u00b1 34 \u03bcg L\u22121, and from 52 to 164 \u03bcg L\u22121, with a mean value of 89 \u00b1 29 \u03bcg L\u22121 in dark beers.

The predictions were made via the establishment of a correlation between the conversion performance and solubility of H2S in ionic liquids (ILs). All molecules involved were optimized at the DFT/TZVP/M06 computational level and imported on the COSMOtherm program at equimolar conditions. For validation purposes, the solubility of ILs was predicted at 1 bar pressure. Simple regression analysis was used to establish a relationship between the solubility and conversion performance of H2S. The results indicate that the solubility prediction of ILs is accurate (R2 = 93.40%) with a p-value of 0.0000000777. Additionally, the conversion performance is generally found to be dependent on the solubility value. Furthermore, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [bmim][Cl] was chosen as the base IL for incorporating the transition metal, owing to its solubility and selectivity to H2S. The solubility trend of ILTMs is found to follow the following order: [bmim][NiCl3] &gt; [bmim][FeCl4] &gt; [bmim][CoCl3] &gt; [bmim][CuCl3]. According to the viscosity measurements of ILTMs, [bmim][NiCl3] and [bmim][FeCl4] exhibited the highest and lowest viscosity values, respectively. Therefore, [bmim][FeCl4] is a promising ILTM owing to its higher solubility and low viscosity for the application studied.</jats:p>",

The aim of this work is to contrast the disadvantages in the production of biocomposites, such as reduction of molecular weight through the use of biobased chain extenders. For this purpose, epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) and dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) were used to contrast the slight chain scission observed in a poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) binary blend caused by the melt mixing with hazelnut shell powder (HSP). Two different dimensions of HSPs were considered in this study as well as different concentrations of the ESO/DCA system, comparing succinic acid and malic acid as dicarboxylic acids. Melt viscosity parameters, such as torque and melt volume rate (MVR), were measured to investigate the chain extender effect during the extrusion. In addition, the reactivity of the ESO/DCA system was investigated through infrared spectroscopy. The effect of chain extenders on thermal properties, in particular on the crystallinity of PLA, and on mechanical properties of final biocomposites was investigated to understand their potentialities in industrial application. Results of this study evidenced a modest increase in melt viscosity due to ESO/malic acid chain extension system, but only for the HSP with the lower dimension (so the higher surface area) and adding 0.5 wt.% of ESO/malic acid. Thus, the slight chain scission of polyesters, not significantly affecting the final properties of these biocomposites, is the most relevant effect that was revealed in this complex reactive system.</jats:p>",

Here we report a method for the rapid preparation of N-acetylcysteamine (SNAC) 7-hydroxy-2-enethioates, which are suitable for the study of various enzymatic domains of megasynthase enzymes.

The optimization of the reaction conditions made it possible to suppress potential side reactions and to introduce the highly functionalized SNAC methacrylate unit in a high yield. The versatility of the sequence was demonstrated by the synthesis of the complex polyketide-SNAC thioesters 12 and 33. Brown crotylation followed by the hydroboration to Suzuki\u2013Miyaura reaction sequence enabled the introduction of the target motif in significantly fewer steps and with a higher overall yield and stereoselectivity than previously described approaches.

Defect energetics, diffusion of Ca ions and a solution of dopants are studied using atomistic-scale simulation based on the classical pair potentials. The energetically favourable defect process is calculated to be the Ca-Si anti-site defect cluster in which both Ca and Si swap their atomic positions simultaneously. It is calculated that the Ca ion migrates in the ab plane with an activation energy of 1.59 eV, inferring its slow diffusion. Favourable isovalent dopants on the Ca and Si sites are Sr2+ and Ge4+, respectively. Subvalent doping by Al on the Si site is a favourable process to incorporate additional Ca in the form of interstitials in CaSiO3.

A unique supramolecular motif was observed when compared with previously published pyrophosphoramide structures having two different intermolecular hydrogen bonding synthons. Furthermore, the potential of a wider variety of supramolecular structures in which similar pyrophosphoramides can crystallise was recognised.

Zeolite impregnation with Cu(NO3)2 resulted in the highest total Cu-loadings, while the Cu(OAc)2-treated samples had the highest Cu+/Cutotal ratio. Cu(NO3)2-impregnated MOR, which displayed the highest concentration of Cu+, was subjected to a number of tests to evaluate its performance as a potential CO sensor. The working temperature and concentration ranges of the sensor were determined to be from 20 to 300 \u00b0C and from 10 to 10,000 ppm, respectively. The stepwise CO desorption experiments indicated that the sensor can be regenerated at 400 \u00b0C if required.

In the present work, the morphological features of the reaction products formed upon the interaction of Fe66Cr10Nb5B19 metallic glass particles with aluminum were studied. The composites were processed via spark plasma sintering (SPS), hot pressing or a combination of SPS and furnace annealing. The reaction products in composites with different concentrations of the metallic glass and different transformation degrees were examined. The products of the interaction of the Fe66Cr10Nb5B19 metallic glass with Al were observed as dense layers covering the residual alloy cores, needles of FeAl3 protruding from the dense shells as well as needles and platelets of FeAl3 distributed in the residual Al matrix. The possible role of the liquid phase in the structure formation of the reaction products is discussed. The formation of needle- and platelet-shaped particles presumably occurred via crystallization from the Al-Fe-based melt, which formed locally due to the occurrence of the exothermic reactions between aluminum and iron. At the same time, aluminum atoms diffused into the solid Fe-based alloy particles, forming an intermetallic layer, which could grow until the alloy was fully transformed. When aluminum melted throughout the volume of the composite during heating of the sample above 660 \u00b0C, a similar microstructure developed.

The method proposed for the synthesis of alumina-magnesia systems provides a high dispersion and a much lower surface acidity for the oxides; in addition, it minimizes or completely excludes wash water, in distinction to the precipitation method.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>As the only enzyme currently known to reduce dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3), nitrogenase is of significant interest for bio-inspired catalyst design and for new biotechnologies aiming to produce NH3 from N2. In order to reduce N2, nitrogenase must also hydrolyze at least 16 equivalents of adenosine triphosphate (MgATP), representing the consumption of a significant quantity of energy available to biological systems. Here, we review natural and engineered electron transfer pathways to nitrogenase, including strategies to redirect or redistribute electron flow in vivo towards NH3 production. Further, we also review strategies to artificially reduce nitrogenase in vitro, where MgATP hydrolysis is necessary for turnover, in addition to strategies that are capable of bypassing the requirement of MgATP hydrolysis to achieve MgATP-independent N2 reduction.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, a new modified chitosan conjugate (Chito-TZ) was developed via amide coupling between the acid chloride derivative of the methylthio-thidiazole compound and the free primary amino groups of chitosan. The product was characterized using several instrumental investigations, including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), 1H-Nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). XRD indicated that the crystalline pattern of chitosan was interrupted after chemical modification with the thiadiazole derivative. Broido\u2019s model was used to determine the thermal activation energy Ea, and the results showed that the Ea for the first decomposition region of Chito-TZ is 24.70 KJ mol\u22121 lower than that required for chitosan (95.57 KJ mol\u22121), indicating the accelerating effect of the thiadiazole derivative on the thermal decomposition of Chito-TZ. The modified chitosan showed better antibacterial and antifungal activities than the non-modified chitosan; except for seed germination, chitosan was better. The Chito-TZ showed a low MIC value (25\u201350 \u00b5g mL\u22121) compared to Chito (50\u2013100 \u00b5g mL\u22121). Moreover, the maximum inhibition percentages for plant-pathogenic fungi, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum, and Fusarium solani, were attained at a concentration of 300 \u00b5g mL\u22121 with values of 35.4 \u00b1 0.9\u201339.4 \u00b1 1.7% for Chito and 45.2 \u00b1 1.6\u201352.1 \u00b1 1.3% for Chito-TZ. The highest germination percentages (%) of broad bean, shoot and root length and weight, and seed vigor index were obtained after Chito treatment with a concentration of 200 \u00b5g mL\u22121 compared to Chito-TZ.</jats:p>",

The mechanochemical approach proved successful for the synthesis of supported palladium nanoparticles with mean diameter within 6\u201310 nm, achieved by the reduction of Pd(II) acetate with ethylene glycol, in the absence of any solvent. A mesoporous N-doped carbon derived from chitin as a renewable biopolymer, was used as a support. Thereafter, the resulting nanomaterials were tested as catalysts to implement a second extrusion based-protocol for the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of iodobenzene and phenylboronic acid. The conversion and the selectivity of the reaction were 81% and &gt;99%, respectively, with a productivity of the desired derivative, biphenyl, of 41 mmol gcat\u22121 h\u22121.</jats:p>",
