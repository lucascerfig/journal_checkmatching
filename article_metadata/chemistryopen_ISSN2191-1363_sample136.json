In particular, we exhaustively investigated the full compatibility of each required step for both tethering strategies. The results demonstrate that click Huisgen and click oxime reactions are fully compatible. However, whilst both approaches can deliver the targeted doubly conjugated oligonucleotide, the route involving click oxime ligation prior to click Huisgen is significantly more successful. Thus the reactions investigated here can be considered to be key elements of the chemical toolbox for the synthesis of highly sophisticated bioconjugates.</jats:p>",

One of the fastest ways of finding putative drug candidates is the use of computational drug discovery approaches. The purpose of the current study is to retrieve natural compounds that have obeyed to drug\u2010like properties as potential inhibitors. Computational molecular modelling techniques were employed to discover compounds with potential SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 inhibition properties. Accordingly, the InterBioScreen (IBS) database was obtained and was prepared by minimizing the compounds. To the resultant compounds, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) and Lipinski's Rule of Five was applied to yield drug\u2010like compounds. The obtained compounds were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies to evaluate their stabilities. In the current article, we have employed the docking based virtual screening method using InterBioScreen (IBS) natural compound database yielding two compounds has potential hits. These compounds have demonstrated higher binding affinity scores than the reference compound together with good pharmacokinetic properties.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the combined inhibition of Hsp90 and B\u2010Raf provides synergistic effects against several types of cancers. Moreover, it has been reported that PDHK1, which presents an ATP\u2010binding pocket similar to that of Hsp90, plays an important role in tumor initiation, maintenance and progression, participating also to the senescence process induced by B\u2010Raf oncogenic proteins.

In this work, we set up a design strategy including the assembly and integration of molecular fragments known to be important for binding to the Hsp90, PDHK1 and B\u2010Raf targets, aided by molecular docking for the selection of a set of compounds potentially able to exert Hsp90\u2010B\u2010Raf\u2010PDHK1 multi\u2010target activities.

The results obtained here (at the M06\u20102X/6\u2010311++G(<jats:italic>d,p</jats:italic>) level of theory) suggest that the activation energies for maleic anhydrides and acetoxy lactones are dependent on the nature of the substituent in the dienophile.

For maleimides, the activation energies are independent of the heteroatom of the dienophile and the R group attached to it.

For maleimides, there is a dual control of interaction and strain energies on the activation energies, whereas for the acetoxy lactones the activation energies seem to be controlled by the degree of template distortion at the transition state. Finally, calculations show that considering a catalyst on the studied cycloadditions changes the reaction mechanism from concerted to stepwise and proceed with much lower activation energies.</jats:p>",

In a previous study, we initiated structure modification of the curcumin scaffold by imination of the labile \u03b2\u2010diketone moiety to produce novel \u03b2\u2010enaminone derivatives. These compounds showed promising properties for elaborate follow\u2010up studies. In this work, we focused on another class of nitrogen\u2010containing curcuminoids with a similar objective: to address the bioavailability and stability issues and to improve the biological activity of curcumin. This paper thus reports on the synthesis of new pyridine\u2010, indole\u2010, and pyrrole\u2010based curcumin analogues (aza\u2010aromatic curcuminoids) and discusses their water solubility, antioxidant activity, and antiproliferative properties. In addition, multivariate statistics, including hierarchical clustering analysis and principal component analysis, were performed on a broad set of nitrogen\u2010containing curcuminoids. Compared to their respective mother structures, that is, curcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin, all compounds, and especially the pyridin\u20103\u2010yl \u03b2\u2010enaminone analogues, showed better water solubility profiles. Interestingly, the pyridine\u2010, indole\u2010, and pyrrole\u2010based curcumin derivatives demonstrated improved biological effects in terms of mitochondrial activity impairment and protein content, in addition to comparable or decreased antioxidant properties. Overall, the biologically active <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010alkyl \u03b2\u2010enaminone aza\u2010aromatic curcuminoids were shown to offer a desirable balance between good solubility and significant bioactivity.</jats:p>",

This binding mode is highly important for radiopharmaceutical applications not to lose the respective radiometal in vivo to avoid high background signals and/or false positive results and damages in other tissues. For this purpose, different calix[4]crowns were tested, based upon their potential to stably bind barium as surrogate for radium. Radium nuclides are known to be good candidates for usage in \u03b1\u2010targeted therapies. Currently, radium\u2010223 is used for \u03b1\u2010therapy of bone metastases because of its calcium mimetics. Our aim is to apply the radium to treat other cancer tissues.

To elucidate the epoxidation mechanism, we systematically performed density functional calculations. The reaction proceeds through a two\u2010step mechanism: activation of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and oxygen transfer. The aqua\u2010coordinated complexes show two distinct H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> activation pathways: \u201ctwo\u2010step\u201d and \u201cconcerted\u201d. The concerted processes are more facile and proceed with similar and rate\u2010determining energy barriers at the Rh\u2010, Pd\u2010, and Pt\u2010containing transition states, which agrees well with the experimental results. Next, the resulting TM\u2212OH\u2212(\u03bc\u2010OOH) intermediate transfers an O atom to olefin to form an epoxide. The higher reactivity of the Rh\u2010containing POM is attributed to more interactions between the Rh and hydroperoxo unit. We also calculated all active oxygen positions to locate the most favorable pathway. The higher reactivity of the two\u2010metal\u2010bonded oxygen position is predominantly ascribed to its lower stereoscopic hindrance. Furthermore, the presence of one and two explicit water solvent molecules significantly reduces the energy barriers, making these sandwich POMs very efficient for the olefin epoxidation with H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>.</jats:p>",

In this study, a process\u2010systems modelling framework for comprehensively evaluating these approaches in terms of both economic and environmental impacts is developed. Applying this framework, treatment pathways are designed, simulated and analysed to determine the most suitable approaches for P removal and recovery.

As another important feature of electron capture dissociation (ECD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), their unique unimolecular radical ion chemistry generally preserves labile posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation.

To analyze various potential reaction mechanisms and to predict the reaction rate constants quantum chemistry and transition state theory were employed. For validation, experimental data from literature and from own experiments were used. Quantitative agreement of experiments and predictions could be demonstrated. The calculations confirm earlier assumptions that urethane formation reactions proceed via mechanisms where alcohol molecules act as auto\u2010catalysts. Our results show that it is essential to consider several transition states corresponding to different reaction orders to enable agreement with experimental observations. Urethane cleavage seems to be catalyzed by an isourethane, leading to an observed 2nd\u2010order dependence of the reaction rate on the urethane concentration.

        "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Protein\u2013protein interactions stabilized by multiple separate hot spots are highly challenging targets for synthetic scaffolds. Surface\u2010mimetic foldamers bearing multiple recognition segments are promising candidate inhibitors. In this work, a modular bottom\u2010up approach is implemented by identifying short foldameric recognition segments that interact with the independent hot spots, and connecting them through dynamic covalent library (DCL) optimization. The independent hot spots of a model target (calmodulin) are mapped with hexameric \u03b2\u2010peptide helices using a pull\u2010down assay. Recognition segment hits are subjected to a target\u2010templated DCL ligation through thiol\u2013disulfide exchange. The most potent derivative displays low nanomolar affinity towards calmodulin and effectively inhibits the calmodulin\u2013TRPV1 interaction. The DCL assembly of the folded segments offers an efficient approach towards the de\u2005novo development of a high\u2010affinity inhibitor of protein\u2013protein interactions.</jats:p>",

A toxicity study was performed on rat mesenchymal stem cells and C6 glioblastoma cells. Adverse effects on viability and cell proliferation were observed at the highest concentration (0.55\u2005mM) only; cell viability was not compromised at lower concentrations. Nanoparticle internalization was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The particles were found in membranous vesicles inside the cytoplasm. Although the metal content (0.42\u2005pg Fe/cell) was lower compared to commercially available iron oxide nanoparticles, labeled cells reached a comparable relaxation rate <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, owing to higher nanoparticle relaxivity. Cells from transgenic luciferase\u2010positive rats were used for in\u2005vivo experiments. Labeled cells were transplanted into the muscles of non\u2010bioluminescent rats and visualized by MRI. The cells produced a distinct hypointense signal in T<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\u2010 or T<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>*\u2010weighted MR images in\u2005vivo.

Interestingly, this enzyme has been shown to catalyze the promiscuous transformation of 3\u2010hydroxyphenyl acetate to 2\u2032,4\u2032\u2010dihydroxyacetophenone, representing a biological version of the Fries rearrangement. In the present study, we report a mechanistic investigation of this activity of <jats:italic>Pp</jats:italic>ATase using quantum chemical calculations. A detailed mechanism is proposed, and the energy profile for the reaction is presented. The calculations show that the acylation of the enzyme is highly exothermic, while the acetyl transfer back to the substrate is only slightly exothermic. The deprotonation of the C6\u2212H of the substrate is rate\u2010limiting, and a remote aspartate residue (Asp137) is proposed to be the general base group in this step. Analysis of the binding energies of various acetyl acceptors shows that <jats:italic>Pp</jats:italic>ATase can promote both intramolecular and intermolecular Fries rearrangement towards diverse compounds.</jats:p>",
