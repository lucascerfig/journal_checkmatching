        "abstract": "<jats:p>This commentary identifies respects in which the theories of culture adopted in the culture and self and sociocultural traditions of cultural psychology are each constrained, in part, by their psychologically grounded research agendas. While tapping non-rational and thematic aspects of culture, research on culture and the self provides only limited insight into its dynamic and heterogeneous nature and into processes of enculturation. In turn, while capturing the fluid and complex nature of cultural systems, sociocultural work neglects its non-rational and thematic aspects. In both traditions, relatively little attention is given to power. The discourse analysis of family interaction undertaken by Pontecorvo and Fasulo (1999) is shown to overcome many of these limitations. Treating culture as an integrated, complex system which is integral to human interaction, their approach captures processes of cultural creation and change as well as power relations. In conclusion, it is argued that there is a need for greater cross-fertilization of ideas across the diverse traditions of research in culture and psychology, while respecting their distinctive insights and agendas.</jats:p>",

Consequently, what persons can do and be is never a form of governance or control by fixed rules; rather, it is always already an orientation to publicly known and material forms of cultural order.

Language is both expressive and repressive, and, therefore, children, in acquiring language, learn to repress rhetorically. The sort of repressions which, according to classic Freudian theory, occur as a result of the Oedipus Complex are themselves dialogically and socially constituted. In consequence, the processes of repression can be examined by extending the techniques of discursive psychology. These ideas are examined in relation to Freud's case of Little Hans, paying attention to the ways that the adults are implicitly practising and teaching repression. It is argued that Freud, in his interpretations, repressed the themes of parental power and desire. The dialogic details show Hans to be developing within a social world in which dialogic repression is habitually practised by adults. The implications of such notions for developmental and discursive psychology are discussed.</jats:p>",

Toomela also proposes a new account of the process of internalization in which language plays the central role. I disagree somewhat with this account, arguing that whereas language is the most powerful human artifact potentiating internalization, other artifacts both material and symbolic-may serve the same function if children are introduced to them in social interactions in which others have intentions toward their intentional states -and they know this. The central theoretical point of Toomela's paper is that a comprehensive account of the human species as a cultural species must focus not only on the cultural collective, but also on individuals and their psychological capacities.</jats:p>",

However, an adequate analysis requires attention not only to cultural realities in which incidents of GSP make sense, but also to the role of psychological activity in reproducing, maintaining and extending those realities. Accordingly, the second part of this analysis emphasizes the less articulated, dynamic-construction side of the MC framework: the role of psychological activity in the reproduction of cultural worlds.</jats:p>",

I propose therefore turn to the philosophical and cultural space in order to analyse the experience of friendship with a place, interpretively extracting those elements of experience that are crucial for in-depth and contextual thinking about man. Here cultural psychology can find inspiration. I deliberately refer to the transcultural space to indicate the possibilities of experiencing the problem of being in a place.

Lyra (1999) draws attention to the importance of using an extended time frame to assess the power dynamics involved within any communicative exchange. The fragments of speech often under consideration in academic texts often preclude an appreciation of such groundwork. This article looks at a group discussion in terms of preceding ethnographic material that contextualises it within a larger socio-educational history. A mapping methodology first traces the power dynamics and different moments of dialogical activity (Lyra, 1999) across the discussion and then details the stances depicted within narratives which have a correspondence to Hermans\u2019 (2001a, 2001b) I-stances. Initially, condensed narratives confirm each other. Subsequently, partial versions of narratives voice divergence. Boje\u2019s (2007) concept of ante-narratives aids the analysis of these latter discursive moves and their role as exploratory devices for considering possible future identity strategies. Taken together these maps contribute to an understanding of selves as dynamic systems (Lyra, 2007, p. 180) tasked with creating coherency and yet responding creatively to uncertainty (Hermans, 2001a).</jats:p>",

With this in mind, it is proposed that at least three theoretical-methodological aspects cannot be lost sight of when considering the experimental study of the cultural transmission process: (1) the relation between Idiographic and Nomothetic science; (2) interdependent relational processes that occur between particularities and generalities; and (3) the need to appreciate continuities and discontinuities as part of the process of construction and analysis of experimental projects.</jats:p>",

In light of his analyses, I argue in this article that systematic inquiries aspiring to generate a situated understanding of human development in Africa should acknowledge and seek to synthesize the complementary strengths of different academic disciplines. And I recommend that African researchers resist the pressure of an enduring Western cultural hegemony embedded in the methodological dictates of many international scholarly, professional and administrative organizations. Such pressure often threatens to do epistemological violence to indigenous modes of thought preferred by local families and communities in whose care African children are growing up. I end by briefly describing some African studies that illustrate ways in which researchers can address the challenge of resisting oppressive hegemony without losing the opportunity to learn from the wisdom accumulated by human development researchers in other socio-cultural and historical contexts. </jats:p>",

Vygotsky\u2019s (1896\u20131934) interests focused mostly on the scholarly study of literary and theatre criticism. Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet served as a leitmotiv to understand the specificity of the arts within western culture: through analysis of the structural particularities of Hamlet, he provided a model for an understanding of how the mind functions during interactions with artworks and reconstructed the internal activity caused by art. His thoughts on the visual arts are few, but fragments are found in his seminal work entitled Psychology of Art (1926). Here, he showed the function of catharsis, the main concept of his theory of aesthetic experience. This paper presents a translation of Vygotsky\u2019s essay published in 1926, dedicated to the art of Alexandr Bykhovsky (1888\u20131978), a companion since his Gomel period (1919\u20131924). The significance of this essay is twofold. First, it represents a concise and lasting testimony to the creativity of an important Russian artist; second, the essay goes beyond formal analysis of the artwork. Instead, Vygotsky\u2019s analysis explains the phenomenon of aesthetic experience as the viewer and the artwork interact and transform each other.

As shame and guilt threaten narcissistic perfection, secrecy functions as a self-protective mechanism by evading acknowledgment of imperfection, thus conceptualizing imperfection as a psychological threat. However, the meaning of perfection and imperfection is culturally grounded, and, therefore, our understanding of family secrets may gain better understanding by examining different cultural perspectives of perfection/imperfection. In this context, we can gain insights to the process of family secrets through wabi sabi, a Japanese aesthetic ideal and philosophy that stresses imperfection as the basis for harmony. In this paper, I suggest an interpretation of family secrets that draws on wabi sabi aesthetics. The paper's main argument is illustrated through a careful reading of Murakami's Kafka on the shore, presenting wabi sabi of family secrets as distinguished aesthetics and a potential source for mental transformation and growth.</jats:p>",

Issues of what happens to historical consciousness in the time of modern technology are examined with reference to how the past is used in the context of electronic archiving of email in corporate cultures. Drawing from ideas in the work of Martin Heidegger concerning interdependencies between the use of technology and the arts of the mind, we examine how the truth of matters is more than an issue of correspondence between language and reality, and more than the rhetorical deployment of what counts as true in establishing stake and interest. We analyse how the work of ordering the archive, which is driven by current projects in the organizations studied, takes place alongside the discursive work of remembering. We illustrate how, without the non-discursive labour of forging relations between components, there is no possibility of playing out evidential strategies that dominate the rhetorical performance of the past. What we call \u2018mind\u2019 and what we call \u2018society\u2019 emerge in this dual ordering.

The re-analysis suggests that the intensity of the dynamic movement of negotiation is greater at moments when we face discernible, close, triggering partners. More intense dynamics lead to a greater involvement of self-affective dimensions as well as a highlighting and clarifying of the oppositions involved in the mechanism of dialogical tensions. However, these features seem to become less pronounced as the intensity of the dynamics rises even more strongly. </jats:p>",

People were asked to describe in detail an occasion in which they experienced shame and an occasion in which they observed someone else experiencing it. Following an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis in which the focus is on what the experiences mean to the people having them (i.e., their lifeworld) four dominant themes were identified: Expectations, self-control, feeling exposed, and bodily reactions and empathy. The study showed how these themes are interrelated: the expectations function as a normative frame that defines what behavior is appropriate in a certain situation, which is present in all the cases. Self-control is a tool required to stay within the normative frame, and when one steps outside the frame, shame and other negative feelings can occur, which can lead to a feeling of being exposed. When describing observations of shame, many participants focused on visible, bodily reactions, along with a normative interpretation about what the other person might be feeling in that specific situation. Another interesting tendency is that some participants would describe observed shame that is similar to their own experience of shame. The discussion applies positioning theory to shame and reflects on shaming at a broader societal level. </jats:p>",

His remarkable career and impact can be outlined in terms of four main phases. The first involved general social psychology in the 1950s and was reflected in Social Norms and Roles (1953/1955). In the second phase during the 1960s and 1970s, he focused on language-related psycholinguistic research leading to publications such as his 1968 volume Words, Meanings and Messages. The third phase came in the 1970s and 1980s and was motivated by his critique of formal linguistics and resulted in his short, magisterial 1974 volume On Message Structure. The fourth phase between 1980 and 2010 focused on \u201cdialogism,\u201d giving rise to works such as his 1992 article \u201cOutlines of a dialogically based social-cognitive approach to human cognition and communication.\u201d Along with his intellectual accomplishments, Rommetveit\u2019s brilliance and generosity inspired students and colleagues at the University of Oslo, as well as from around the world.

We work through Arendt\u2019s ideas and discuss them in relation to social psychological theorising to consider how the concept of friendship can deepen our understanding and analyses of the relationalities that underpin thinking. We specify that whilst thinking in existing social psychological accounts may be read as adversarial in nature (e.g. through a focus on its oppositional character), the relationship between thinking and friendship has been an important idea underlying the perspectives presented in such works. Distinguishing between thinking as friends and thinking in groups, we suggest that there may be something special about the role of friendship in thinking. We draw out this idea by turning to Arendt, and simultaneously use the work of social psychologists to reconsider aspects of The Life of the Mind, in which thinking is mostly conceptualised as a solitary activity. </jats:p>",

Hypnogenesis is a concept for how clinical relationships tend to reproduce the ideas and theories of the therapist in the subject\u2019s subjectivity. In hypnotherapy, hypnogenesis is implicated in the relational nature of the hypnotic experience, addressing the difficulty in separation between fabricated and revealed realities.

The participants\u2019 encounter with global modernity and contradictory discourses of religion create ruptures and uncertain social conditions in their lives. I examine how Italian Muslim women strategically use religion to subvert the meaning of hijab, Islam and patriarchy, and the Italian Catholic women challenge orthodox views about abortion, God, and the Catholic Church. I argue that the religious experiences of these women are constantly interacting with location of race, religion and gender and are continually transforming all the ambiguous meanings present in various axes of difference that make up their identity.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p> This conceptual paper explored the purposes of using culture in the process of coping with stress by looking how first-year undergraduate students used cultural elements and activities to aid their transition into university. Results supported two key conceptualisations of the use of culture. First, results indicated that students used culture either for withdrawal purposes, that is, for escaping from the stressful situation, or for engagement purposes, that is, for actively engaging with the stressful situation. Second, the results suggested three different forms of using culture to engage with stressful situations: mood management, learning and personal interaction. While the results of the study resonate with the distinction between avoidance versus approach-oriented coping strategies that are widely explored in the stress and coping literature, they also suggest that the relationship between withdrawal and engagement might be dynamic with those two strategies serving distinct purposes in the process of coping with stress. This paper thus suggests that there is a need to develop process-oriented models of coping that would allow identifying patterns in the way people fluctuate between withdrawal and engagement that support and facilitate their personal growth and development. </jats:p>",

Border is not just a non-place, but is a space with its own characteristics that makes living there very specific, regulating the dynamic with the surroundings and even the way of thinking, acting and feeling. Living in a borderland makes the identity of the inhabitants and their meaning-making process very peculiar. The way in which the border residents perceive the relationship between the self, the others and the environment, as well as their process of meaning-making is unavoidably linked with the existence of the border itself, with all its ambivalent theoretical features and practical implications in settling the daily activities and the human psychological functioning. </jats:p>",

In both cases, the problem is how to use historical knowledge in constructing identity narratives when the knowledge is contradictory. In this context, some issues analyzed in Carretero and Kriger\u2019s and Tileag\u00e3\u2019s work are discussed. Carretero and Kriger (2011) demonstrate that students in Argentina are largely unable to present a logically coherent story of the origins of their country. The difficulties the students experienced were related to the fact that the task they had to solve was highly artificial. They had to offer a high-level rational analysis of ideological texts which is not needed for the successful functioning of these texts. Tileag\u00e3\u2019s (2011) paper is about how a former secret informer of the KGB-like organization in Communist Romania copes with the fact that his disgusting secret becomes public. In the coping process, the person makes use not only of his own memory, but also of his diaries as well as of the Securitate documents in the archives. All the three sources provide tools for reshaping identity and self-esteem, which can never be totally negative.

        "abstract": "<jats:p> Economic theory propagates a model of the human being commonly known as homoeconomicus; an individual with a rational orientation directed towards maximizing his/her preferences. However, our everyday lives involve many altruistic acts. These can range from small gestures of kindness such as holding a door open for another person, to heroic feats such as risking one's life to save a child from drowning. During our lives we also meet certain people that instantly induce our kindness. Our nicety in these moments is not based on a pursuit to optimize our material desires. Rather, we allow our feelings and intuitions to guide the course of our actions. How do we reconcile these experiences against the economic conception of human nature as inherently selfish? Addressing this contradiction, the paper will deconstruct the economic view and repositioning it as the product of an epistemological stance that distorts our view of altruism. An alternative model on altruism will then be developed by merging anthropological theories on value with insights from cultural psychology and grounded cognition. Through this process, a passage will be shown from static and universalizing perspective towards an emergent and dynamic theory on altruism. </jats:p>",

In order to alter some dominant and traditional Western ethnotheories, suggestions are made for taking into account both parents and relevant kin group members, not just the mother figure. Given the diversity of the existing ethnotheories, and the diversity of social strata, cultural psychology of parenting needs to go beyond the usual middle-class models. The need for an awareness of the dialogical processes established among researchers and participants is also highlighted. Finally, it is suggested that discourse analysis should go far beyond verbal communication, analyzing other kinds of social languages. </jats:p>",

It is emphasized that the attention process happens depending on the apparently individual volitional acts but notoriously established during social relationship. Social genesis and perceptions which are expressed in gestures, looks, and speeches point to a complex construction perception of oneself, of the other and of the music in teaching relationships. </jats:p>",

Here, one school assumed to have contributed to the widening of our understanding of the cultural or environmental influence on individual development is presented in some detail. This school of thinking is compared to another European conceptualization of an integrated view on person-culture exchange (discussed in this issue). Biological, cultural-philosophical and psychological aspects were linked together in a school established at the newly founded university at Hamburg, Germany, during the 1920s and early 1930s. Cooperation by three scientists from different disciplines pushed forward the idea of a holistic concept describing the process of development within context. William Stern, the psychologist, Ernst Cassirer, the cultural philosopher, and Jakob Johannes von Uexkull, the biologist, worked together and successfully developed an integrated perspective on the exchange between the individual and his or her environment. Although never manifest as a 'school' in its own right, it is maintained that the three scientists' interdisciplinary efforts to grasp a holistic explanation of the subject-environment relationship is found in many components remaining in contemporary theories exploring links between individual and environment. </jats:p>",

The development of lived musical practice draws its force from a situated tradition that consists of normative, structural and stylistic elements, and of a constellation of genres and values shaped and reshaped by generations of practitioners.

This notion of realism (which we coined \u2018\u2018expressive realism\u2019\u2019) highlights how sociality is inseparably related to embodied experience, thus making way for a sociocultural psychology that takes into account life as it is experientially lived. We point out how Hermans\u2019 vision of the Dialogical Self neglects such embodied experience. This discussion leads to the claim that Bakhtin sees the self as social insofar as our most primary embodied experience is social, where Hermans anchors the sociality of self in inter-subjective exchange.

A particular issue is the assumption that culture is transmitted to people, that it is primarily a collective endeavour based on shared values and that culture can endow work with meaning.

We argue that work is inherently a meaningful activity, mediating between personal and collective culture. We end by proposing some potential new directions to explore.</jats:p>",

This paper reviews four major controversies that lie in the areas of (a) theoretical ambiguities, (b) social determinism, (c) cognitive reductionism and (d) lack of a critical agenda. A detailed discussion and evaluation of these criticisms reveals that while some can be regarded as misinterpretations, others need to be treated as serious and constructive suggestions for extending and refining the current theoretical framework. The main argument underlying this review is that many of the criticisms are based on the difficulty in understanding and integrating the complex, dynamic and dialectical relationship between individual agency and social structure that forms the core of social representations theory. Engaging with the critics is thus thought to provide clarification and to initiate critical dialogue, which is seen as crucial for theoretical development.</jats:p>",

        "doi": "10.1177/1354067x221097607",
        "year": 2022,
        "abstract": "<jats:p> The prominent imagery of Menshen (\u95e8\u795edoor gods) within traditional Chinese culture has led to the development of a variety of cultural symbols, including military door gods, civil door gods, praying door gods, and other related ones, such as stone lions and Shigandang (stone tablets). This article studies the impact of the belief in Door Gods and their worship on Chinese psychology and behaviour on both a conscious and unconscious level. At the conscious level, from its first articulation to its development into a cultural image and related myths and legends, the belief in Door Gods can be said to have gone through four stages: a primitive worship of reproduction in ancient times, animal worship during the Zhou Dynasty, the worship of anthropomorphic gods during the Han Dynasty and the worship of hero gods worship during the Tang Dynasty. This process corresponds to the four specific symbols of \u2018peach branch\u2019, \u2018tiger/chicken\u2019, \u2018Sh\u0113n Sh\u016b(\u795e\u837c)\u2019 and \u2018Y\u00f9 L\u01dc(\u90c1\u5792)\u2019 (\u2018\u9b3c\u2019: the two spirits guarding the entrance of the house), and \u2018hero\u2019. On an unconscious level, the psychological symbolism of the belief in Door Gods belief is interpreted through the Door Gods sacrifice and the Fu(\u590d)\u201d hexagram. Closing the door is related to Kun (\u5764, the receptive, earth), while opening the door is related to Qian (\u4e7e, the creative, heaven). Together, Kun and Qian were held to be in a state of continual transition, one changing into the other, which reflects Chinese philosophy\u2019s emphasis on movement. Traditionally, Chinese people held more than 10 kinds of door-related sacrificial activities every year. Although some of these activities have gradually fallen out of use, the traditional custom of pasting door couplets and images of Door Gods to doorways has been preserved. By repeating the ritual every year, the Chinese gain the strength to protect themselves and their family members. Clinical studies of sandplay therapy have found that the image of Door Gods constitutes a \u2018patron saint\u2019 on an unconscious level. Door gods guard the boundary between consciousness and unconsciousness (the inner and outer worlds), thereby protecting the spiritual strength of those who supplicate them. This suggests that using their images in a therapeutic context could help individuals to maintain boundaries and protect themselves. The emergence of the Door Gods image can transform the guardian energy hidden at the border between unconsciousness and consciousness, help the clients keep the boundary and protect themselves. </jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper theoretically examines how the psycho-pathological concept of hysteria has evolved since its emergence in antiquity, what causes contributed to it and how nowadays meaning-making systems of clinical psychology are mirrored through it. As has been shown, the transformation of hysteria is more closely related to the cultural psychology of feminism than any other disease before it. The 20th century in particular marked a significant change in the conceptualization of hysteria. From a highly sexist and paternalistic it became a political diagnose and finally was used, after getting banished from the psychological dictionary as an everyday pejorative personality adjective. It underwent a transformation within its gender classification, which was initially limited exclusively to women. Later, it became a psychiatric diagnosis, which was no longer durable nowadays and has finally changed into the concept of histrionic today. The analysis shows how, on the one hand, medical and biopsychological findings and, on the other hand, especially political movements and their cultural psychological processes of change form the basis of psychopathological concepts. It will be shown to what extent hysteria is exceptionally exemplary for this change in psychological meaning-making. In this context, the close connection between hysteria and the emancipatory development of our society could be emphasized. </jats:p>",

        "year": 2014,
        "abstract": "<jats:p> While the issue of power within the research relationship has been evoking constructive discussions for over two decades in qualitative research, existing approaches fail to understand power both as macro-socially determined and interpersonally negotiated in the micro-space of research communication. In this article, I use ideas from Social Representations Theory (SRT) to conceptualize the macro-social conditions that give meaning to power asymmetries expressed through the identities in the micro-space of the research relationship and to examine how these identities and their power asymmetries mediate research communication. Three instances of research between a local researcher and immigrant participants are analyzed. Analysis shows that the identities of a Greek researcher and immigrant participants introduce power asymmetries in the research communication due to the meanings they carry in the Greek social context. These asymmetries mediate communication by evoking reflection, challenge, resistance and reversal of positions. It is suggested that this double micro and macro focus achieved through SRT contributes to qualitative methodology by inviting important questions regarding data construction (under which identities are data constructed, how are they constructed and why are they constructed in such a way) and by advancing an epistemologically reflective stance to research. Further, the present approach contributes to SRT by advancing a power-inclusive understanding of interpersonal dynamics, which is considered underdeveloped by SR theorists. </jats:p>",

Of principal interest is the bearing of the work of C.S.

It appears that the expression of emotion in language is embedded in multiple fields of rather different types and performs different semantic functions.

Notwithstanding the profound distortion of the concepts of femininity and masculinity in the course of the modernization and islamization of the country, defeminization of the public space and prioritization of the masculinity in gender discourses have been crucial to all social transitions that intend to feed their desired social-ideal identity. Iranian homosexuals, who are condemned both for their sexuality and nonconformist gender effeminacy, have recently formed fictive kinships and backstage friendship groups in order to negotiate and attain a new social identity. In this paper I will examine the basic reasons behind the rejection of homosexuality in Iran and the ventures of the Iranian gays into cyberspace and back to society, while struggling to construct a new feminine-admissive social identity. The final part of this study is devoted to the discussion of the seat of femininity, particularly effeminacy, among Iranians. The paper concludes with demonstrating the incomplete social identity formation of gays, but also envisages a rising divergence in Iranian youths\u2019 gender behaviors which grants the likelihood of negotiating the newly developed social identity to homosexuals. </jats:p>",

Do culture-inclusive psychologies depart from this schema and look into ways in which gender-related phenomena are culturally shaped? This article overviews two types of psychological texts. First, it examines classic psychological texts belonging to four selected schools of thought: cultural-historical psychology (Leont\u2019ev, Luria, Vygotsky), critical psychology (Holzkamp, Holzkamp-Osterkamp), social constructionism (Mary and Kenneth Gergen), and action-oriented cultural psychology (Boesch, Straub). Second, it compares articles published in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology and Culture &amp; Psychology. This overview reveals that differences in conceptualizing gender are significant, covering a spectrum ranging from naturalistic to constructionist frameworks.</jats:p>",

Thousands of viewers all over the world contributed to the discussion of the meaning and implications of this event, turning it into a global event in the participatory culture of contemporary seriality. In this article, we propose an explanation of this remarkable cultural phenomenon. Based on a theory of plot twists as surprise structures, we argue that the reactions of fans can be understood as concrete, contextually adapted realizations of the characteristic cognitive reactions evoked by the emotions of surprise and shock caused by unexpected negative events. Our analysis focuses in particular on the contributions of viewers to the establishment of the beliefs disconfirmed by the plot twist and on the cognitive activities that served to adapt their minds to the new reality revealed by the twist, which also included reflections on the aesthetic aspects of the plot twist and the narrative in which it was embedded. By providing a public platform for these reflections, the fan forums allowed the individual attempts to adapt to the plot twist to become a collective endeavor. The study illustrates how universal cognitive mechanisms interact with culturally produced contents to generate similar reactions to a fictional event across the globe.</jats:p>",

First, the SCPT is outlined in terms of its nine underlying tenets. Then, SCPT is used to frame an interpretation of the psycho-social dynamics underpinning the current socio-political scenario. Based on the SCPT model, the spread of affective sensemaking in current societal dynamics is interpreted as being due to the capacity of affects to work as semiotic stabilizers, enabling people to face the deep uncertainty fostered by the economic and political turmoil associated with globalization. </jats:p>",

While these recent concepts may expand the canvas from which researchers draw in developing interventionist approaches for minoritised students, they nevertheless polarise positive and negative emotions and experiences which is problematic on a conceptual level. This paper addresses this issue by first presenting how funds of identity and existential funds of identity have been theorised, arguing that there remains a tension between the distributed theory of the original conceptualisation of funds of identity and the phenomenological and subjective dimension that underpins existential funds of identity. In order to resolve this tension, I situate the funds of identity concept within a cultural historical tradition, drawing upon Gonz\u00e1lez Rey\u2019s work on subject sense and subjectivity in order to propose an alternative conceptualisation of funds of identity that allows researchers to transcend the dichotomy of positive and negative emotions.</jats:p>",

Zittoun's perspective is cultural as well as developmental, and can thus make visible the dynamicity of individual meaning-making processes, a semiosis taking place in the field of self, other, culture and objects which are used as symbolic resources in constructing identity. Zittoun proposes a three-dimensional model of the use of symbolic resources ( aboutness , time and distancing), accompanied by two theoretical constructs: the semiotic prism and the spheres of experience. This complex and transparent architecture is investigated empirically through the case studies of thirty young people whose interviews are thoughtfully analysed. Although Zittoun relates a person, others, a cultural element and the meaning of this element for the person in a dynamic semiotic movement of change, she does not elaborate on the dialogical dimension of this movement of change. It is otherness of and `in' objects which then comes to the foreground. This opened but not developed path is taken up by the reviewer, leading to the notion of dialogical objects: objects which are actually dialogical processes, developing in time within an exchange of voices and positions. Using a dialogical object as symbolic resource means activating the dialogical self; and investigating these uses gives the opportunity to observe the dialogical self in construction. Semioticity, accompanying and forming identity processes, is thus to be completed with alterity, giving these processes orientation and sociocultural value. </jats:p>",

More broadly, the article contributes insights into how child-rearing practices and beliefs reflect local conceptions of the person and the world, and how the child should be prepared to live in it. Issues raised here include the challenges of distinguishing among cultural, psychological, and political economic influences of migration, urbanization, and globalization, and delineating the ways in which intimate personal concepts interweave with wider forces in child-rearing. Also at issue are definitions of relatedness and autonomy, concepts which are widely deployed in cross-cultural studies of child-rearing, but which are based upon Western philosophical formulations, and which McShane et al. analyze in the Inuit urban case. These concepts are difficult to formulate in culture-\u2019neutral\u2019 or \u2018etic\u2019 terms. The article shows both the uses and the limitations of retaining analytical \u2018odd-job\u2019 concepts for heuristic purposes.

More specifically, the aim of this study is to explore and understand the difference between Estonians' autostereotype of their extreme individualism and the opposing opinion held by the cross-cultural research community that sees Estonia as a collectivistic country. The findings show that the definitions and conceptualizations of individualism and collectivism by cross-cultural psychologists and Estonian lay-people are indeed only partially overlapping. If Estonians speak about their individualism or collectivism, they seem to emphasize their being/acting alone versus being/working in groups, whereas for cross-cultural researchers the defining attributes of individualism are striving for affective and intellectual autonomy and egalitarian values versus conservatism. Moreover, the findings clearly suggest that the concepts of individualism and collectivism are conceptualized differently not only in Estonian public discourse and academic discourse, but also within academic discourse in cross-cultural psychology. It seems that behind the solid and broad fa\u00e7ade of individualism-collectivism, multiple concepts co-habit with rather diverse meanings. Future research should redirect its focus on the core elements of individualism and collectivism in order to clean the concepts of the deposited layers of meanings and implications and to help them to win back their status of principal cultural dimensions.</jats:p>",

Participants experienced the socio-cultural contexts of mainstream academia and tribal communities as incongruent and based on conflicting values associated with the conceptualizations of individualism versus relationality and communal cooperation. Viewing these seemingly dichotomous concepts from the perspective of Native American tribal world views, however, enabled meaningful integration of these concepts. The innovative relational individuality conceptualization allows for appreciation of uniqueness and self-improvement efforts without adherence to the mainstream principle of competitive individualism. At the core of the involved conceptualization of relationality, with preference for communal cooperation, is the experience of one\u2019s embeddedness in personal relationships and one\u2019s involvement within groups as a valuable member, which cannot be explained by either the necessity of socio-economic and ecological factors or the imperative of conformity to collective conventions. The extent to which the independence\u2013interdependence and individualism\u2013collectivism dichotomies apply to this case is limited. The discussed relational individuality conceptualization, facilitated by Native American tribal world views and culturally specific narratives, extend the repertoire of thus far recognized mechanisms that underlie the existing cultural variation.</jats:p>",

In particular, this article contributes novel insights concerning the importance for identity construction and experiencing of the fact that the status of Native American tribal nations is politically and legally unique, and their situation historically and socio-culturally in many regards different from that of ethnic minority populations. Correspondingly, master narratives that fundamentally favor either full inclusion into the dominant society or the idea of tribal sovereignty and self-determination seem to facilitate distinct ways of construction and experiencing of qualitatively different identities. Some of these are conducive to constructive interpretation, integration, and coping within mutually incongruent socio-cultural contexts. Master narratives that carry such potential under adverse circumstances constitute an important asset within the contemporary ever more diverse, yet interconnected societies. </jats:p>",

Overall, in our qualitative study, we found that representations of culture and religion influenced social practices and social beliefs in different ways: non-practising Muslim women felt bound by culture to remain virgins, while practising Muslim women saw it as a religious obligation but were still governed by culture regarding the consequences of engaging in premarital sex. Interestingly, some practising Muslim participants used Mut\u2019a (a form of temporary \u2018marriage\u2019) to justify premarital sex. This, however, did not diminish the importance of virginity in their understanding and identification as Arab women. In fact, this study found that virginity, for the British Arabs interviewed, embodied a sense of \u2018Arabness\u2019 in British society. Positioning themselves as virgins went beyond simply honour; it was a significant cultural symbol that secured their sense of cultural identity. In fact this cultural identity was often so powerful that it overrode their Islamic identities, prescribing their behaviour even if religion was seen as more \u2018forgiving\u2019.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper aims to discuss the rejection of subjectivity by psychologists dominantly oriented towards concepts like discourse and deconstruction, as well as communicative and relational activities. The recognition of the symbolic character of human phenomena by psychology occurred relatively late in relation to philosophy, linguistics and anthropology. Nonetheless, this entrance was so radical that it led psychologists to deny most of the concepts that have traditionally been used by psychology. This paper departs from theoretical traditions that advanced a step further in the comprehension of the human psyche as a cultural-historically engendered phenomenon. On this basis, a new definition of subjectivity is advanced as a phenomenon that emerges as a result of the symbolical forms which are socially and historically situated, from which concepts like discourse, deconstruction and dialogical-communicative systems also appeared. Subjectivity, as treated in this paper, is oriented toward specifying human processes that are not exhausted in these concepts, being complementary to them in a broader and complex approach to the study of human realities.</jats:p>",

Still, the ways in which the environment is structured, and the very importance attached to the notion of predictability, will vary in different cultural contexts. Findings from an ethnography of daily life at an Israeli kindergarten over the 2001 school year show how the teacher, albeit unwittingly, shaped an environment that was inherently unpredictable . This unpredictability, in turn, served to mobilize personal resources and social practices among the children as a means not only of coping with the unpredictability, but of turning it to their advantage. Studies of Israeli Jewish youth reveal that the resources that are appropriate for successfully managing in an unpredictable environment are indeed salient and positively valued also at later stages in life. It is argued that socialization into an unpredictable environment at an early age reflects an enduring and characteristic facet of Israeli culture with regards to child-rearing. </jats:p>",

I propose that Einar\u2019s upbringing in the cycles of crisis characterising fishery, combined with other factors, led him to develop a particular engagement with the future that mitigated crisis-induced uncertainties. Previous crises served as resources to address current calamities, as such experiences taught Einar that, in even the direst situations, the future will eventually improve. However, Einar temporarily sight of the future when the Faroese fishery industry imploded in the 1990s. Einar questioned whether sufficient resources existed to allow him and the village to recover. The 1990s crisis momentarily gained a personal character; however, due to his age, stable socioeconomic position, and close social and affective ties to the people on Su\u00f0uroy, he reaffirmed his decision to stay on the island.

        "abstract": "<jats:p> The analysis of the different articles in this special issue gives a rather promising but complex image of a dialogical approach to psychology. Mikael Leiman proposed utterances as the object of study for psychotherapy research, semiotic mediation as the explanatory principle, and semiotic position as the unit of analysis. Frank Richardson cautioned us about how dialogical proposals can become entrapped by the extreme decentering tendency of social constructionism. James Cresswell, in his turn, claimed that Bakhtin's work is precisely a way of avoiding the unbalanced account of personal vacuity and freedom found in many constructionist accounts: it is precisely because we are bound to social ties that we become ethically involved with others and, indeed, with ourselves. Mich\u00e8le Grossen and Anne Salazar Orvig claimed that otherness and the institutional, transpersonal dimensions are also present in every dialogical act, something that tends to be overlooked. Moore et al., following this suggestion, pointed to the multiplicity of institutional social frames, adding to the potential tension between the different available ways of interpreting self and context. Following these various contributions, the authors argue that a dialogical conception implies a relational self in constant dialogical and ethical involvement with society. They further argue that to respect the complexity of the whole in each lived situation, we need different, and more conversational, research strategies. In a final synthesis, centrifugal and centripetal movements of the self are conceived as mutually dependent in a fundamentally temporal conception of psychological becoming. </jats:p>",

The present study examines how Chinese people living in the Netherlands account for their ethnic identity. The focus is on the actual accomplishment and manifestation of ethnic self-definitions in talks with other Chinese. The analysis highlights the different resources the participants use to manage the normative issues and personal responsibilities involved. Accounts were accomplished by stressing the significance of appearance, the importance of early socialization and the (non-)possession of critical attributes. However, these deterministic accounts leave little room for personal agency, and the participants also tried to define an active and constructive role for themselves.

Next, acculturation theory focuses on these students\u2019 cultural transition and provides further insight into potential strategies for their handling of specific cultural conflicts such as cannabis use.

        "abstract": "<jats:p>This study compares Muslim women\u2019s views on wearing the veil in a Muslim majority society, Indonesia, with the Muslim minority in India. In-depth interviews reveal significant differences between the two: Majority women talk in terms of convenience, fashion, and modesty with little reference to religion as their reasons for veiling. The responses of Muslim minority women are diverse: their account of veiling stretches from religiously inspired arguments through to reasons of convenience, and to opposition against stereotypes and discrimination. Most minority women see the veil as a way of affirming their cultural identity. We argue that religious minorities are forced into constructing their cultural identity in ways that exaggerate their group belonging and difference from broader society. This may be motivated either by falling back on religious resources or by using ethnic markers to overtly oppose endemic prejudice. No such identity issue exists for the Muslim majority women. This contradicts the dominant view in non-Muslim countries in the West, where the female scarf is primarily considered a symbol of religious fundamentalism and patriarchal oppression.</jats:p>",

Ten Cypriot Turkish people\u2019s identities were explored through semi-structured interviews. Discourse analysis was used to identify the discursive constructions of identity and belongingness. Discourses that constructed the Cypriot Turkish Australian identity were: modern Muslim, language, phenotype and ancestry and generation discourse. These discourses give rise to the multi-hyphenation of this identity, positioning them as either Cypriot Turkish Australians or Cypriot Turkish in Australia. The discourses have highlighted not only the current socio-political context as shaping subjectivities, but also the historical and political collective memory that continues in the construction of ethnic identities.</jats:p>",

This editorial analysis continues the tradition of inquiry started in previous efforts (Valsiner, 2001, 2004a) and extends it to the needs of psychology as a whole for the study of dynamic, meaning-making human beings. Cultural psychology\u2014using the term culture as a generic term in various versions\u2014continues to be an arena where innovations can occur. Separate research fields\u2014 such as the dialogical self, social representation processes, semiotic mediation, symbolic action, and actuation theories\u2014have all been co-participants in this new advancement of ideas. Yet the central problem\u2014an innovation of empirical research methodology which would appropriately capture human active meaning-making\u2014has not been solved. Likewise, cultural psychology has only marginally touched upon the lessons from indigenous psychologies\u2014the richness of folk psychological terms, and the cultural over-determination of objects used in human everyday living. Contemporary cultural psychology turns increasingly towards the study of objects as cultural constructs. Editing a journal is itself an act of construction of a cultural object, and the current state of contemporary scientific journals indicates a re-construction of the social nature of knowledge. Moving beyond its postmodernist and empiricist confines, psychology is set to return to the level of an abstracted generalization of its culture-inclusive theories. Culture\u2014in terms of semiotic mediators and meaningful action patterns\u2014is the inherent core of human psychological functions, rather than an external causal entity that has `effects' on human emotion, cognition, and behavior.</jats:p>",

From the Enlightenment onwards quite sophisticated schemes have been put forward, and some of these bear a close resemblance to salient aspects of the Berry et al. model. The status of that model is discussed in the light of its historical background, which also indicates that the current division between universalist and particularistic approaches to psychology and culture can be found to some extent in the writings of past thinkers. </jats:p>",

Problems that arise from the acognitive-adevelopmental position of the sociocultural approach are analyzed in respect of three issues: ethnocentrism, the natural-cultural line of development, and testing in education. The cultural-historical approach, in turn, is deficient in ignoring cultural diversity and the content of the psyche.

        "abstract": "<jats:p> The aesthetic dimension of meaning-making in human conduct has been often overlooked. In this article, \u201caesthetic\u201d refers to an immediate form of experiencing in which affective, ethical and cognitive dimensions are experienced as a totality, rather than a more restrictive meaning of artistic experience. The philosopher Giambattista Vico (1670\u20131744) developed the concept of \u201cpoetic logic,\u201d that is a specific mode of thought typical of early stages of civilization. Poetic logic is the first form of collective elaboration of experience, a way of creating universals concepts based on sensory, affective sense-making and religious thinking. Vico claims that poetic logic was the cornerstone for the elaboration of whole systems of collective knowledge (poetic economy, science, geography, history, law, etc.) crystallized in myths. Poetic logic, based on imaginative function is a proper epistemological stance that, though overcome by rationality at a later stage of civilization, still plays an important function in keeping alive the ethical dimensions of collective life against the \u201cbarbarism of reflection.\u201d Two centuries later, Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803\u20131882), one of the fathers of Pragmatism, developed an idea of poetic and imagination as forms of knowledge. Though echoing Vico\u2019s ideas, he represents the aggressiveness of modernity. From the discussion of their ideas, I will try to sketch the psychological aspects of the aesthetic dimension of experience that can be found in a wide range of human activities, including actions of killing, overpowering and social injustice. I will try to argue that meaning-making is oriented through processes that affect such aesthetic dimension. </jats:p>",

While the sheer presence of disabled students does not automatically equate to a robust disability culture, it became apparent that there was a disability culture at this site, and therefore the research question was refined to: What are the features of disability culture according to this population? The participants were all students at an institute of higher education in the Midwestern United States. The researcher self-identifies as having a disability. Using in vivo coding for analysis to preserve the voices of the participants themselves, the results indicated that there was a disability culture and the key values defining this culture included independence, social justice, and giving back to others. </jats:p>",

(b) How could we conceptualize the fact that Subject\u2013Alter interactions are not only interpersonal but entail larger social entities, in particular institutions?

We discuss these three questions from two standpoints \u2013 that of linguistics and that of psychology \u2013 and illustrate our theoretical proposals with an analysis of an excerpt taken from a focus\u2013group discussion. In conclusion, we argue that the dialogism of discourse provides us with some clues about the dialogicality of the mind, whereas the latter invites us to develop a theory showing the importance of interactions in the construction of the self, to pay more attention to the transpersonal dimension of the social, and to consider that the material world contributes to the construction of the self.</jats:p>",

In particular we are concerned with the use of symbolic resources in moments of developmental transitions, that is, the mobilization of symbolic elements ranging from shared bodies of knowledge or argumentative strategies to movies, magazines or art pieces. The paper begins with a brief theoretical sketch of these ideas, and then presents three case studies, each of which involves the use of a different type of symbolic resource within a particular age group. In the first, children are observed in interaction with a peer about a conservation problem. In the second, adolescents are observed negotiating the meaning of their art productions with their peers, teachers and parents. The third example looks at Western tourists searching for spirituality, adventure and freedom in Ladakh as an alternative to the materialism of modernity. In each case the analysis of the symbolic resources employed indicates the significance of the gaze of the other in the construction of meanings, and of the various constraints operating within specific situations. The analysis also reveals different modes of use of symbolic resources, linked to changing forms of reflectivity. </jats:p>",

Yet, this universal language is not solely a play; it has an educational drive to educate the mind and to help the individual reaching inner harmony. This play comes into being only when listening to the play of other people interacting with me and me meditating upon the multiple meaning making opportunities of it. I argue that such a perspective is in close accordance with the actual task of Cultural Psychology helping to unravel how people do relate to their environments and the impact that results from this ecological interaction. However, I appeal interested readers in trying to better institutionalize such a cultural psychological purpose of serving the individual in order for Cultural Psychology to be a sustainable and long-lasting science unlike the Glass Bead Game that became an end in itself. </jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>At the core of Heinz Werner\u2019s concept of development is what he called \u201cthe genetic principle of spirality:\u201d over the course of ontogenetic development, lower levels, processes, and functions do not disappear, and can even resurface again under specific conditions, normal and pathological. Werner\u2019s work with Bernard Kaplan on symbol formation is a primer on this idea. This paper examines the idea of spirality and develops the notion of dynamic coexistence that can clarify the issue of directionality of development; that is, what is the general trajectory or ground plan that development assumes. Directionality is discussed in terms of the organism-in-environment unfolding over time as the unit of developmental analysis. Thinking on this issue has proceeded from the nature\u2013nurture debates, to recognition of the interaction of external and internal processes, to transactions between the organism and the environment. The idea of dynamic coexistence is developed on this foundation. In the context of Werner and Kaplan\u2019s work, dynamic coexistence represents the syncretic nature of processes and levels of organization: they are neither innately fused nor organized. Instead, the antithesis between fusion and differentiation is resolved only in concrete, context-bound conditions, even as development is generally oriented towards differentiation in maturity. Idiographic science, with its orientation towards generalizing from the unique and its attention to intra-individual variation over time, is discussed as the adequate methodological orientation for Wernerian developmental analysis.</jats:p>",

The increasingly mobile and changing conditions of some professional sectors have made transnational career trajectories imaginable also for many partners.

Participants were 18\u201322\u00a0years old during the interviews but were charged with committing an offense as minors. An adapted life story interview guide was used to conduct in-depth, face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with the CICL which elicited stories of their past, present, and future. REC-approved protocols and research guidelines for juvenile justice populations were followed in gathering data. Thematic analysis showed that almost all the CICL had sama ng loob or resentments in the past, experienced pagbabagong-loob or a sense of renewal in the present, and expressed their desire to make up by giving back to others in the future because of their utang na loob or sense of gratitude to those who have helped them. The development of the inner self of the CICL from past to present to the future can be described as Nagib\u00e2-Nabubuo-Babawi or Collapsed-Taking Shape-Giving Back. Findings of the study provide a glimpse of the inner self of the CICL from their perspective. It highlights the dynamic movement of the CICL\u2019s inner self which has implications for prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation efforts in relation to youth offending. </jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>The psychological concept of attachment is constantly evolving. Approximately 70 years after attachment theory was first introduced by John Bowlby in the late 1940s, the notion of attachment is still in flux with continually changing ideas of what it means to be a good parent. One path along which attachment as a concept is moving from academia to everyday life is the philosophy of attachment parenting which was first established in the US by William and Martha Sears. Ideas about attachment theory and attachment parenting are frequently accompanied by critical comments on \u201cWestern\u201d cultures. This critical perspective on modernity, individualism, and autonomy is portrayed in the first part of this article. The second part traces attachment as a concept transferred to Turkey. Rather than studying academic work on attachment in Turkey, this article focuses on popularized versions of attachment theory which gain ground as part of the parenting philosophy of attachment parenting. This article analyzes parents\u2019 blogs, websites, self-help books, fieldwork protocols, and interviews with parenting trainers and parents themselves. It focuses on how popular scientific use of attachment parenting in Turkey is accompanied by discussions of cultural identity, cultural values, and belonging. The article shows that attachment theory and parenting are used in quite diverse ways to comment on Turkish (parenting) culture, ranging from anglophile readings to more conservative appropriations of attachment theory as Anatolian education. These forms of popularizing attachment theory challenge the sociological concept of psychologization.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the discursive production of a psychologized bulimic subject. Two processes are highlighted through a case study, both influencing the production of the bulimic: therapeutic operations of power; and the subjugation of non-psy accounts of bulimia. Power mechanisms in therapy encourage the client to construct a complex psychological subjectivity, enabling a psychological, self-contained account of her eating disorder, thereby facilitating \u2018therapeutic\u2019 change. However, the condition for therapy is the disguised subjugation of client, lay and erudite non-psy accounts. The concealment of power operations reinforces psy\u2019s hegemony in defining the person\u2014and the bulimic\u2014in western culture. After problematizing psy discourses, a non-psychologized feminist discourse is hypothetically considered, and dialogue with this discourse suggested. A feminist discourse does not require ideals of self-containment, nor complex psy accounts, but nevertheless offers the bulimic a range of political subjectivities as a discursive priority, rather than psychological complexity.</jats:p>",

        "year": 2005,
        "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper relies on Vygotsky's thesis that preschool children in role play are acting in the zone of proximal development (ZPD). One aim is to specify this thesis with respect to language development. The empirical investigations show that language is the central means of creating pretence. By explicit metacommunication, children collaboratively negotiate the plot, transform meanings and distinguish fiction from reality. Thus, metacommunication functions as a verbal frame, determining the meanings within play. Thereby children overcome sympraxic language use which is characteristic of toddlers. Another result is that role play changes during the preschool years. The paper argues that these changes can be subsumed under a general developmental phenomenon, namely the transition of interpsychic into intrapsychic processes. A point of special interest is why preschoolers, through role play, can act in the ZPD, although their ability to cooperate with other children is only at a nascent stage. To explain this, the paper discusses several aspects of psychosocial development. </jats:p>",

This conflict between grief and cultural ideals of happiness is reflected in the recent efforts within bereavement research to delineate pathological mourning from uncomplicated, normative mourning. While the latter is characterized by a gradual decline in emotional pain, sadness, lack of initiative, etc., complicated mourning is marked by a failure to meet normative standards for recovery. In this article, I will draw on loss experiences among bereaved parents in contemporary Danish society in order to shed light on how profound losses may catalyze estrangement from and opposition toward what has been termed the happiness imperative of contemporary Western societies. More specifically, I borrow the figure of the feminist killjoy, paraphrased as the grieving killjoy, as a lens through which bereavement experiences may be theorized and understood as a starting point for experientially driven cultural critique.</jats:p>",

This anthropologist argues that sorcery, notwithstanding its status as an older, classic topic in the history of anthropology and its seemingly \u201cexotic\u201d reputation, has continuing value in recent efforts to de-colonize the study of local ontology and moral personhood, in particular, in contexts of transcultural encounters. The focus here is on an incident in a Saharan Tuareg community that is locally-defined as \u201csorcery\u201d (called ark echaghel in Tamajaq, their Amazigh language). Many Tuareg, predominantly Muslim, traditionally semi-nomadic, and socially-ranked, have experienced socio-economic and ecological upheavals, armed conflicts, and settled life in towns. This analysis examines a case of sorcery practice and its social context\u2014of a transcultural encounter between a smith/artisan and a tourist and its aftermath\u2014of diagnosis and commentary by an Islamic scholar\u2014as moral discourse and local psycho-social treatment as critical commentary on and resistance to transcultural inequalities. The broader goal here is to suggest avenues to pursue by showing how sorcery reveals local ontology, moral discourse on evil, and culture theory. Thus, sorcery, rather than a \u201cretrograde\u201d or irrelevant topic, offers rich insights into local ontology\u2019s psycho-social and political implications, thereby contributing to current concerns in transcultural psychiatry with social and political power asymmetries, critical epistemologies, and indigenous critiques that question universalizing absolutist psychological interpretations in cultural encounters. </jats:p>",

The CoL model conceptualizes the classroom as a set of cultural contexts where dialogues permit the analysis of context and also shape it. Empirical examples of how relevant concepts related to learning, such as motivation and sense-making, can be viewed as innovation of the self are discussed.</jats:p>",

Each dimension indicates an increase in aspects that make the respect less conditional and more intrinsic, while requiring higher sensitivity and greater effort.

At the same time the theory has its critics; some of them argue that the theory is too loose; others, that it is too cognitive; that it is not clear how the concept of social representation differs from other concepts, say, from attitudes, social cognition, beliefs, stereotypes, and so on; still others would like to marry the theory either to discourse analysis or to social constructivism(s) and constructionism-or to both of them at the same time. Readers of French, in addition, are familiar with Moscovici's work in the history and philosophy of science, human invention and technology, the psychology of resistance and dissidence, and, most recently, with his magnificent autobiographical recit Chronique des annees egarees (Chronicle of Stray Years) (Moscovici, 1997).

Thus, rather than seeking to explain a child\u2019s present activities in terms of their causes in the past, from the standpoint of an external observer, we can turn to a quite different aim: that of perceiving in a present behavior the possibilities and opportunities it offers for further developments.

Specifically, human bodies, which are the medium and locus of experience, are embedded in social situations and institutions. Thus embodied experience, the origin of meaning, must be understood as societally structured. Moreover, human experience is never unmediated; it is refracted through the complex semiotic artifacts that comprise human culture, such as discourses, social representations and symbolic resources. The present article focuses on the importance of bodies moving within institutions and minds moving within semiotic structures as a basis for meaning making. We argue that such movement has been neglected; yet, it has the potential to enhance our understanding of how experiences are differentiated and integrated within individuals to produce individuals who are products of society and who also have agency in relation to society.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p> Conducting research in indigenous settings in rural villages, where traditional leaders are the custodians of communities remains a challenge. Traditional health practitioners have to adapt their protocols to the needs of the cultural setting. When gaining access to a setting, researchers have to follow a process that respects the autonomy of individuals, thus adhering to one of the ethical principles of research with human participants. In this paper, the researchers reflect on gaining access to conduct research with traditional health practitioners and traditional leaders in Vhembe district, South Africa. Researchers participated in sharing circles, and identified five reflective themes. The themes included initiating agreement and rapport, continuous negotiation and compromise, Them and Us, adhering to local dress code and ritual performance. Researchers planning to conduct research with traditional health practitioners and traditional leaders should consider these themes in the preparation phase. </jats:p>",

Empirically, social-spatial analysis is elaborated by looking at how social difference is produced in multi-ethnic schools through classroom interaction both in the USA and in the Netherlands. In our analysis, we are concerned with how \u2018\u2018school\u2019\u2019 becomes evoked or produced in student discourse while ethnic positions are established. At the same time we show how spaces such as migrant neighborhoods and homelands are evoked and related to school spaces. The results show that more general mechanisms can be distinguished of how students use these spaces in their constructions of otherness across the data sets, but that the quality and complexity of these mechanisms are specific and can be related to the more general (migration) histories of the ethnic groups. </jats:p>",

        "year": 2010,
        "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article we contribute a new theoretical perspective to the analysis of the relationship between individual and culture, and the person and the environment. Many hotly debated issues in cultural psychology, such as reification, the discourse of personality traits, and models of part\u2014whole hierarchies are productively addressed. Taking a systems-theoretical approach following Niklas Luhmann and others, we distinguish three different types of system and their operational processes (biotic, psychic and social) and suggest that the person\u2014environment relationship should be conceptualized as a process of co-evolution of psychic and social systems. We discuss the critical role of communication in this process and its implications for the concept of culture. Our own research on classroom disruptions and problem behavior in educational settings provides illustrative examples for the kinds of methodological considerations generally relevant to a systems-theoretical approach in empirical research.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p> The article serves as an introduction to Boesch's theory from the personal point of view of an author who has interacted with Boesch for a long time. First, three roots of Boesch's enterprise are located (Boesch's clinical work, his interest in contexts, and his own scientific heritage), and their implications for his theoretical framework are drawn. In a second section the intrinsic relationship among some of Boesch's key concepts is illustrated (actor, action, cognitive and affective schemata, symbolism, fantasms and myths). In a third part some thoughts about the future of Boesch's theory are offered. Here it is claimed that in Boesch's theory the social world is not as adequately elaborated as is the world of objects, and that this is a task for the future. Additionally, some methodical and methodological implications are enumerated, which follow from an action theory that is built upon a potentially self-reflective subject who is to be respected also as a moral patient. </jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p> The psychological phenomenon of a suddenly appearing, extremely enigmatic, and at the same time fascinating state in which one feels influenced by higher powers was described as a \u201cnuminous experience\u201d by R. Otto and C. G. Jung. This condition is one of those subjectively non-rational experiences that have so far received little attention in cultural clinical psychology and yet have great potency to explain psychopathological phenomena. In the first section of this paper, we work towards a contemporary psychological definition both by focusing on the roles of paradoxical cognitions and dissociation and by presenting various differentiations and possible explanatory mechanisms. In the second part of this paper, we describe the numinous state as it occurs in selected clinical phenomena such as the subjective experience of potentially traumatic events including near-death experiences, sexual abuse of children, post-traumatic stress disorder, severe states of mourning (diagnosed today as prolonged grief disorder), and sleep paralysis. This paper is intended as a theoretical proposal aimed at better understanding subjectively non-rational states in patients. </jats:p>",

Our main goal is to analyze the personal process of (re)construction of lesbian identity and its connection with socio-cultural context. The autobiographical narratives of eight (8) lesbian women were analyzed and categorized in accordance with a model that describes the construction of homosexual identity in three phases: before Self-definition, Self-definition, and after Self-definition. The analysis conducted allowed us to describe, in an integrated and coherent way, the process that led the participants to a dialogical and personal position in the flow of social discourses about homosexuality they are involved in. </jats:p>",

I begin with an overview of an alternative view of language to the one adopted in Boesch\u2019s question, one that starts from a usage-based approach. Next I move on to consider empirical findings from recent research that examines language and the construction of self. Agreeing with Boesch\u2019s central claim, this article nevertheless offers a distinct view of the connection between language and human development suggesting that language not only provides a tool for the researcher, but also provides a powerful means for the child to come to interpret culturally sanctioned ways of being in the world. </jats:p>",
