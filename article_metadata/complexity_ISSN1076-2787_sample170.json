        "abstract": "<jats:p>Logistics service (LS) has key impacts on customers\u2019 satisfaction. Quality function deployment (QFD) can guarantee that logistic services provider\u2019s (LSP) attributes are in accordance with the customer\u2019s preferences for the LS. The partitioned Heronian mean (PHM) operator assumes that all attributes are partitioned into several clusters. Herein, the attributes in the same clusters are interrelated, while the attributes in different clusters are independent, and the operator can be utilized to solve LSP selection (LSPS) problems in which all attributes are partitioned into several clusters. Interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) can more competently express the ambiguity and vagueness and have more powerful processing abilities. In this paper, we propose a novel LSPS method from the customers\u2019 perspective by combining QFD with the PHM operator in IT2FSs environments. First, we develop the interval type-2 fuzzy PHM (IT2FPHM) operator and the interval type-2 fuzzy weighted PHM (IT2FWPHM) operator and discuss some properties of them. Then, based on the relationships between the customer requirements (CRs) and the technical attributes (TAs), QFD is utilized in order to convert the CRs for LS concerns into multiple attributes for LSP\u2019s TAs. Finally, a case of a fresh E-business LSPS is used in order to demonstrate the validity and rationality of the proposed method, and some comparisons are used in order to show the superiority of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

Due to the complexity of the indoor environment, signal occlusion problems could lead to the failure of certain positioning methods. In complex environments, such as those involving fire rescue and emergency rescue, the barometric altimeter fails because of the influence of air pressure and temperature. This paper used an optimal gait recognition algorithm to improve the accuracy of gait detection. Then a learning-based moving direction determination method was proposed. With the Kalman filter and a zero-velocity update algorithm, different gaits could be accurately recognized, such as going upstairs, downstairs, and walking flat. According to the recognition results, the position change in the vertical direction could be reasonably corrected. The obtained 3D trajectory involving both horizontal and vertical movements has shown that the accuracy is significantly improved in practical complex environments.</jats:p>",

We quantitatively analyzed the comprehensive utilization pattern of the Bohai Rim coastline, China, in terms of the coastline utilization type and spatial agglomeration characteristics. The comprehensive utilization pattern of the Bohai Rim coastline is as follows: ecological areas are present in the north and south, and industrial areas are present in the east and west. Industrial production areas along the coastline are mainly distributed in the East Liaodong and Bohai bays, and ecological protection areas are located in the estuaries of the Liaohe and Yellow River. The improved restricted comprehensive index method model weakens the interaction among variables and makes the calculation results closer to the real situation. The results of the comprehensive utilization pattern of Bohai Rim coastline obtained by quantitative evaluation are of great significance for the coordinated development of coastline ecological protection and development and utilization.</jats:p>",

Over the last years, in particular, there has been an increasing number of agent approaches proposed along with an ever-growing interest in their various implementations. Yet a comprehensive and full-fledged agent approach for developing related projects is still lacking despite the presence of agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) methodologies. One of the moves towards compensating for this issue is to compile various available methodologies, ones that are comparable to the evolution of the unified modeling language (UML) in the domain of object-oriented analysis and design. These have become de facto standards in software development. In line with this objective, the present research attempts to comprehend the relationship among seven main AOSE methodologies. More specifically, we intend to assess and compare these seven approaches by conducting a feature analysis through examining the advantages and limitations of each competing process, structural analysis, and a case study evaluation method. This effort is made to address the significant characteristics of AOSE approaches. The main objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of selected AOSE methodologies and provide a proposal of a draft unified approach that drives strengths (best) of these methodologies towards advancement in this area.</jats:p>",

But in gPCEM, a nonlinear transformation of random variables should always be used to adapt the generalized Polynomial Chaos theory for the analysis of random problems with complicated probability distributions, which may introduce nonlinearity in the procedure of random uncertainty propagation as well as leading to approximation errors on the probability distribution function (PDF) of random variables. This paper aims to develop a flexible polynomial expansion method for response analysis of the finite element system with bounded random variables following arbitrary probability distributions. Based on the large family of Jacobi polynomials, an Improved Jacobi Chaos Expansion Method (IJCEM) is proposed. In IJCEM, the response of random system is approximated by the Jacobi expansion with the Jacobi polynomial basis whose weight function is the closest to the probability density distribution (PDF) of the random variable. Subsequently, the moments of the response can be efficiently calculated though the Jacobi expansion. As the IJCEM avoids the necessity that the PDF should be represented in terms of the weight function of polynomial basis by using the variant transformation, neither the nonlinearity nor the errors on random models will be introduced in IJCEM. Numerical examples on two random problems show that compared with gPCEM, the IJCEM can achieve better efficiency and accuracy for random problems with complex probability distributions.</jats:p>",

In order to improve the convert performance of the wireless communication system in the FD mode, a scheme based on selection combining/zero forcing beamforming (SC/ZFB) is proposed. More specifically, a covert message receiver with a FD multiantenna uses the zero forcing beamforming method to transmit randomly varying noise power to the adversary while receiving covert information from the sender. Firstly, we derive the optimal detection threshold and the corresponding closed expression of the minimum detection error rate of the warden. Secondly, the transmission interruption probability is explored to measure the communication reliability between the sender and the receiver of the covert message. Finally, the throughput performance of the covert communication system is analyzed under random geometry. Our analysis shows that the proposed SC/ZFB scheme can achieve the positive effective convert rate while interfering with the detection of the warden as much as possible. It is worth noting that the increase of the number of antennas and the power of covert message transmission can improve the convert performance of the system.</jats:p>",

Then by regarding the time delay as the bifurcation parameter and analyzing the characteristic equation, some new sufficient criteria to guarantee the stability and the existence of Hopf bifurcation for the controlled fractional-order chaotic Genesio-Tesi model are derived. The research shows that when time delay remains in some interval, the equilibrium point of the controlled chaotic Genesio-Tesi model is stable and a Hopf bifurcation will happen when the time delay crosses a critical value. The effect of the time delay on the stability and the existence of Hopf bifurcation for the controlled fractional-order chaotic Genesio-Tesi model is shown.

By visualizing the detailed dynamics underlying this phenomenon in a simple virtual economy, the elements underpinning the synergistic effect on economic output produced by the division of labor between agents could be dissected. These are heterogeneity or spatial or temporal heterogeneous environment and/or agents; complementary activities of agents, with divergent optimization options; and synchrony.

The result demonstrates that the hydropower generation system in this study case can operate safely, which is in a good agreement with the corresponding theory and actual engineering. Thus, the framework of dynamic safety assessment aiming at transient processes will not only provide the guidance for safe operation, but also supply the design standard for hydropower stations.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it is important to study the dynamic characteristics and implement the wet clutch test of HMCVT. In this paper, AMESim is used to establish virtual models of gearbox, pump-controlled hydraulic motor system, and shifting hydraulic system.

        "abstract": "<jats:p>The heterogeneous information networks are omnipresent in real-world applications, which consist of multiple types of objects with various rich semantic meaningful links among them. Community discovery is an effective method to extract the hidden structures in networks. Usually, heterogeneous information networks are time-evolving, whose objects and links are dynamic and varying gradually. In such time-evolving heterogeneous information networks, community discovery is a challenging topic and quite more difficult than that in traditional static homogeneous information networks. In contrast to communities in traditional approaches, which only contain one type of objects and links, communities in heterogeneous information networks contain multiple types of dynamic objects and links. Recently, some studies focus on dynamic heterogeneous information networks and achieve some satisfactory results. However, they assume that heterogeneous information networks usually follow some simple schemas, such as bityped network and star network schema. In this paper, we propose a multityped community discovery method for time-evolving heterogeneous information networks with general network schemas. A tensor decomposition framework, which integrates tensor CP factorization with a temporal evolution regularization term, is designed to model the multityped communities and address their evolution. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our framework.</jats:p>",

The navigation network consists of the navigation stations as nodes and the routes between them as edges. Different nodes have different effects on the vulnerability of the network due to their different abilities to maintain the stability of the network topology and the normal function of the network. To quantify this difference and identify key nodes that have a greater impact on the vulnerability of the navigation network, an indicator to assess the importance of a navigation station is proposed which combines the structural importance reflected by node topology centrality and functional importance reflected by node weight. The structural importance of a node corresponds to its topology features including local dominance of the node and its global influence, and the important contribution to both adjacent and nonadjacent nodes from this node, while the functional importance is indicated by the flight flow serviced by the node during a fixed period of time. Vulnerability evaluation shows that the navigation network is more vulnerable when subject to the intentional attack of nodes with higher comprehensive node importance than an intentional attack of nodes with a larger value of indicators used in previous literature. Finally, the vulnerability of the navigation network is improved through changing the topology of the most critical node and balancing the node importance of the whole network.</jats:p>",

First, the unreliable links are described by stochastic connections, reflecting the characteristic of changing connectivity gleaned from dynamic WSNs. Secondly, based on the mutual drift estimation, each pair of activated nodes fully adjusts clock rate and offset to achieve network-wide time synchronization by drawing upon the gossip consensus approach. The converge-to-max criterion is introduced to achieve a much faster convergence speed. The theoretical results on the probabilistic synchronization performance of the RGCS are presented. Thirdly, a Revised-RGCS is developed to counteract the negative impact of bounded delays, because the uncertain delays are always present in practice and would lead to a large deterioration of algorithm performances. Finally, extensive simulations are performed on the MATLAB and OMNeT++ platform for performance evaluation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are not only efficient for synchronization issues required for dynamic topology changes but also give a better performance in terms of converging speed, collision rate, and the robustness of resisting delay, and outperform other existing protocols.</jats:p>",

Based on the PSR model, this paper builds a comprehensive evaluation index system for urban industrial ecosystem development and selects 14 prefecture-level cities in Liaoning Province of the traditional industrial area in Northeastern China as cases to calculate the development level of its industrial ecosystem during 2000\u20132018 using an improved Topsis method and then to conduct a spatial visualization analysis. Finally, based on the \u201cstress-state-response\u201d subsystem, this paper diagnoses the constraints for industrial ecosystem development, which can provide a reference basis for decision-making in industrial ecology of traditional industrial area represented by those in Northeast China. The results show the following: (1) From 2000 to 2018, the industrial ecology of the 14 cities in Liaoning Province was at a medium level. Except for Shenyang and Dalian with the rapid development, the difference of industrial ecosystem development for other cities was relatively small. (2) From 2000 to 2018, the industrial ecosystem development of each city was in a status of \u201ceither increasing, or decreasing, or fluctuating,\u201d which generally raised first and then decreased. Regarding spatial difference, the development exhibited a \u201ccenter-periphery\u201d pattern, with Shenyang and Dalian as the \u201cdual-core\u201d that were increasingly strengthened with significantly high-level industrial ecology. (3) At system level, PSR constraint grades for the industrial ecosystem development in the 14 cities of Liaoning Province were different. Constraint grades in the pressure subsystem, the state subsystem, and the response subsystem for the industrial ecosystem of Liaoning were 45.73%, 20.01%, and 34.34%, respectively, indicating that the lack of human response to the ecological environment and the pressure of human activities on the ecological environment during the industrial economy development were the main constraints affecting the process of industrial ecology in these cities. (4) Due to the differences in geographical environments, economic bases, industrial structures, and local development contexts, the major constraint factors of industrial ecosystem development in different cities are significantly different and complicated; however, there are five factors that are generally considered as major constraint factors in all cities, i.e., regional GDP, number of labor force employed in the secondary industrial sector, gross investment in fixed assets, amount of industrial sulfur dioxide removal, and production value from \u201cthree-wastes\u201d comprehensive utilization.

An actor-critic structure-based algorithm is proposed in this paper for sizing complex depth profiles. By learning with more information from the depth profile without knowing the corresponding MFL signal, the algorithm proposed saves computational costs and is robust. A pinning strategy is embedded in the reconstruction process, which highly reduces the dimension of action space. The pinning actor-critic structure (PACS) helps to make the reward for critic network more efficient when reconstructing the depth profiles with high degrees of freedom.

The second part of the paper discusses the memory factor on the stabilization of the map\u2019s equilibrium point. A gradient mechanism that depends on the marginal profit in the past two time steps is adopted to incorporate memory in the model. Hence, a 2D discrete dynamic map is constructed. Through theoretical and numerical investigations, we show that the equilibrium point of the 2D map becomes unstable due to two types of bifurcations that are Neimark\u2013Sacker and flip bifurcations. Furthermore, the influence of the speed of adjustment parameter on the map\u2019s equilibrium is analyzed via numerical experiments.</jats:p>",

Through the observations from a typical cross-border supply chain network, this paper introduces the fuzzy reliability-oriented 2-hub center problem with cluster-based policy, which is a special case of the well-studied hub location problem (HLP). This problem differs from the classical HLP in the sense that (i) the hub-and-spoke (H&amp;S) network is grouped into two clusters in advance based on their cross-border geographic features, and (ii) a fuzzy reliability optimization approach based on the possibility measure is developed. The proposed problem is first modeled through a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation that maximizes the reliability of the entire cross-border supply chain network. Then, some linearization techniques are implemented to derive a linear model, which can be efficiently solved by exact algorithms run by CPLEX for only small instances. To counteract the difficulty for solving the proposed problem in realistic-sized instances, a tabu search (TS) algorithm with two types of move operators (called \u201cSwap I\u201d and \u201cSwap II\u201d) is further developed. Finally, a series of numerical experiments based on the Turkish network and randomly generated large-scale datasets are set up to verify the applicability of the proposed model as well as the superiority of the TS algorithm compared to the CPLEX.</jats:p>",

To solve this problem, suboptimal trajectories with constant relative distance constraints are first found with inverse methods, which were referred to as ideal displaced geostationary orbits.

Depth images in a continuous sequence are addressed to obtain the real-time height of the pedestrian with moving. Firstly, a normalization equation is presented to convert the depth image into the grey image for a lower time cost and better performance.

Thirdly, a segmentation algorithm based on the maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs) is introduced to extract the pedestrian head region. Then, a novel multilayer iterative average algorithm (MLIA) is developed for obtaining the height of dynamic pedestrians. Finally, Kalman filtering is used to improve the measurement accuracy by combining the current measurement and the height at the last moment.

For this reason, the Shanghai Stock Exchange issued a notice on December 4, 2015, deciding to implement the circuit breaker mechanism on January 1, 2016. However, the mechanism was abolished only four days after its implementation. Therefore, this paper provides an empirical effectiveness analysis of this circuit breaker mechanism based on the nine CSI 300 industries using the regression discontinuity design method. The empirical results show that the implementation of the circuit breaker mechanism has led to the breakpoints of volatilities in nine industries and has significantly increased its market fluctuation. Moreover, we also find that the implementation of the circuit breaker mechanism has different impacts on the different industries, such as the effectiveness of the public, and consumer industries are at the medium level and show more stable fluctuations. Therefore, we suggest that the further circuit breaker mechanism in China\u2019s financial markets can be piloted from the public and consumer industries rather than directly implementing it on the whole CSI 300.</p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>The dynamic parameter allocation of the suspension system has an important influence on the comprehensive driving performance of the tracked vehicle. Usually, the allocation of suspension parameters is based on a single performance index, which has the disadvantage of not being able to achieve multi-performance optimization. Therefore, a novel optimization method using multi-performance index-oriented is presented. Firstly, considering the vertical vibration excitation caused by road roughness, the input (excitation) model of road roughness is embedded to establish the parametric dynamic model of the tracked vehicle. Then, the evaluation index and its quantitative algorithm, which reflect the multi-aspect performance of the suspension system, are proposed. Moreover, the parameter allocation objective function based on multi-index information fusion is designed. Finally, two allocation optimization methods are presented to solve the parameter allocation, i.e., equal weight allocation and expert knowledge-based weight allocation. By comparing the results obtained by the two methods, it is found that the performance of the suspension system can be improved effectively by optimizing the parameters of suspension stiffness and damping. Furthermore, the optimization of weight allocation based on expert knowledge is more effective. These provide a better knowledge reference for suspension system design.</jats:p>",

In particular, the nonuniform routing track configuration and obstacles bring the largest difficulty for maintaining the same topology for all bus bits. In this paper, we first present a track handling technique to unify the nonuniform routing track configuration with obstacles. Then, we formulate the topology-aware single bus routing as an unsplittable flow problem (UFP), which is integrated into a negotiation-based global routing to determine the desired routing regions for each bus. A topology-aware track assignment is also presented to allocate the tracks to each segment of buses under the guidance of the global routing result. Finally, a detailed routing scheme is proposed to connect the segments of each bus. We evaluate our routing result with the benchmark suite of the 2018 CAD Contest. Compared with the top-3 state-of-the-art methods, experimental results show that our proposed algorithm achieves the best overall score regarding specified time limitations.</jats:p>",

Two dynamic Stackelberg game models have been built involving both a manufacturer and a retailer assumed to be the leader in order. In the two models, the manufacturer sells national-brand (NB) product to an independent retailer or directly to consumers through a direct channel. The retailers sell a store-brand (SB) product when they sell the NB product coming from the manufacturer. Thus, there is competition both in different channels and in products with different brands. To analyze the complexity of the model, parameter bifurcation diagrams and strange attractor diagrams have been therefore plotted. The results show that the game leader has advantages when the market is stable, but it turns disadvantageous if the state falls into unstable as the game follower can quickly adjust the strategy to seize the market. The wholesale price and the direct selling price are high that they incur larger profits if the manufacturer is dominant, but it gets worse when the adjustment speed increases. While in the model where the retailer plays a dominant role, the increase in the adjustment speed is unfavorable to retailer. By controlling the total cost of the direct channel and increasing channel competition strength and brand competition strength, the manufacturers can increase their profits in the game dominated by the retailer. In addition, the stable region within the system will be narrow since the market is sensitive to the channel competition, brand competition, and advertising indifference.</jats:p>",

The design of structural parameters of the shaft is the critical link in the four-stage gearbox; it affects the response of multiple input and output branches; however, only the meshing pairs were frequently shown in the dynamic model in previous research. Therefore, each shaft is also treated as a single node and the shaft parameters are coupled into the dynamic equations in this method, which is more accurate for the transmission chain. The differential equations of the system are solved by the Fourier series method, and the dynamic response of each meshing element is calculated. The sensitivity analysis method and parameter optimization method are applied to obtain the key shaft parameters corresponding to each meshing element. The results show that the magnitude of dynamic response in converging meshing pair and tail output pair is higher than that of other meshing pairs, and the wall thickness has great sensitivity to a rotor shaft. In addition, the sensitivity analysis method can be used to select the corresponding shaft node efficiently and choose parameters appropriately for reducing the system response.</jats:p>",

The ADRC is composed of a tracking differentiator (TD), an extended state observer (ESO), and a nonlinear state error feedback (NLSEF). Such constructed ADRC can adapt to the strong nonlinear and complicate working conditions of diesel engine for power generation. A simulation model of the diesel engine is built to verify the proposed ADRC, and simulation results are in good accordance with the experimental results. To further validate the advantages of the designed ADRC, the traditional PID is improved by TD. Meanwhile, performance comparisons are carried out between traditional PID controller, improved PID controller, and ADRC. Results present that the improved PID controller can achieve a better control performance than that of the traditional PID controller both in steady state and transient state. However, the ADRC can further improve the speed control performance evidently on the basis of the improved PID controller.</jats:p>",

Based on continuous-time Markov procedure, a dynamic large-scale server scheduling problem in this complicated service network is modeled with consideration of different arrival rates of multiple type of patients and different service capacities of multiple servers that can be defined as doctors of the general hospital. To solve this model, a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed, where the reward functions are designed for four conflicting subcosts: setup cost, patient waiting cost, penalty cost for unsatisfied patient personal preferences, and medical cost of patient. The experimental results show that the optimal service rule of each server\u2019s queue obtained by the RL method is significantly superior to the traditional service rule.</jats:p>",

The main idea of this paper is to develop a composite control including a PI control and repetitive control for a single-phase grid-connected inverter to eliminate the effects of harmonics, which can obtain better steady-state and dynamic responses of the single-phase inverter system and reduce the net current harmonics. The modelling of a single-phase inverter is first introduced; then a first-order repetitive control is developed for the proposed grid-connected inverter. Moreover, a high-order repetitive controller is adopted to further improve the robustness against the uncertainties in the period of signals. The stability and performance analysis are given for the first-order repetitive control and high-order repetitive control. Finally, comparative simulations are conducted in a circuit-level inverter model, which show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

Agent\u2010based models provide a powerful theoretical tool for investigating this relationship, but until now have not considered the effects of local neighborhoods or mobility on emergent population dynamics. In failing to do so, they have effectively ruled out the population\u2010level complexity inherent in human mate choice. Real people live in physical space, and their interactions are constrained by their location in and mobility among physical neighborhoods and social networks. We developed a general model of human mate choice in which agents are localized in space, interact with close neighbors, and tend to range either near or far. At the individual level, our model uses two oft\u2010used but incompletely understood decision rules: one based on preferences for similar partners, the other for maximally attractive partners. We show that space and mobility can interact nonlinearly with these individual decision rules and nonspatial aspects of the population structure. In particular, local interactions and limited mobility decrease interpair matching and increase mate search time. We also show that it is too easy to fit various model configurations to the scant available data. More data and more specific predictions are required. Human mate choice is a complex system with properties that emerge from space, mobility, and other factors that structure social dynamics. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Besides, the system has the properties of complex electromechanically coupling such as the coupling between electrical parameters and mechanical parameters. Therefore, in this study, the nonlinear torsional vibration equation was established on the basis of the Lagrange-Maxwell theory. Moreover, in light of the nonlinear dynamic bifurcation theory, the system stability was analyzed by taking the resistance value of power motor as the bifurcation parameter. In addition, the influence of subcritical bifurcation on the torsional vibration was studied by investigating the necessary and sufficient conditions for dynamic Hopf bifurcation and classifying the bifurcation types. At last, in order to suppress destabilizing oscillation induced by Hopf bifurcation, the nonlinear feedback controller was constructed, with the introduction of feedback from the motor velocity as well as the selection of voltage value on the <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math> shaft as the controlled variable.

In this paper, we studied a spatial public goods game with nonlocal interdependency groups where each of participants is located in a two-dimensional square lattice or Watts\u2013Strogatz small-world network with payoffs obtaining from the interactions with nearest neighbors. In terms of the enhancement factor, the effects of group density on the evolutionary cooperation can be quite different. For a low enhancement factor, the cooperation level is a nonmonotonic function with the varying density of interdependency groups in the system, which means a proper density of interdependency groups can best promote the cooperative level. For a moderate enhancement factor, a higher density of interdependency groups can always correspond to a higher cooperative level. However, if the enhancement factor is too high, a high density of interdependency groups can impede the evolutionary cooperation.

In the steady-state control process, RBF NNs are verified to satisfy the partial persistent excitation (PE) condition. Subsequently, an appropriate state transformation is adopted to achieve the accurate convergence of neural weight estimates. The corresponding experienced knowledge on unknown robotic dynamics is stored in NNs with constant neural weight values. Using the stored knowledge, a static neural learning controller is developed to improve the full-state tracking performance.

However, there is less work considering the possible organized spatial patterns achievable by non-self-propelled particles (nondriven), i.e., those obeying energy and momentum conservation. Moreover, it is not known how the potential energy interaction between the particles affects the complexity of the patterns. To address this, in this paper, a collective motion model with a pairwise potential energy function that conserved the total energy and momentum of the particles was implemented. The potential energy function was derived by generalizing the Lennard\u2013Jones potential to reduce to gravity-like and billiard-ball-like potentials at the extremes of its parameter range. The particle model was simulated under a number of parameterizations of this generalized potential, and the average complexity of the spatial pattern produced by each was computed. Complexity was measured by tracking the information needed to describe the particle system at different scales (the complexity profile). It was found that the spatial patterns of the particles were the most complex around a specific ratio in the parameters. This parameter ratio described a characteristic shape of the potential energy function that is capable of producing complex spatial patterns. It is suggested that the characteristic shape of the potential energy produces complex behavior by balancing the likelihood for particles to bond. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that complex spatial patterns are possible even in an isolated system.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>We investigate a multiplex network of the guarantee market with three layers corresponding to different types of guarantee relationships in China. We find that three single-layer networks all have the scale-free property and are of disassortative nature. A single-layer network is not quite representative of another single-layer network. The result of the betweenness centrality shows that central companies in one layer are not necessarily central in another layer. And the eigenvector centrality has the same result of the betweenness centrality except the top central company.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>When facing the problem of reconstructing complex mesoscale network structures, it is generally believed that models encoding the nodes organization into modules must be employed. The present paper focuses on two block structures that characterize the empirical mesoscale organization of many real-world networks, i.e., the<jats:italic> bow-tie</jats:italic> and the<jats:italic> core-periphery</jats:italic> ones, with the aim of quantifying the minimal amount of topological information that needs to be enforced in order to reproduce the topological details of the former. Our analysis shows that constraining the network degree sequences is often enough to reproduce such structures, as confirmed by model selection criteria as AIC or BIC. As a byproduct, our paper enriches the toolbox for the analysis of bipartite networks, still far from being complete: both the bow-tie and the core-periphery structure, in fact, partition the networks into asymmetric blocks characterized by binary, directed connections, thus calling for the extension of a recently proposed method to randomize<jats:italic> undirected</jats:italic>, bipartite networks to the<jats:italic> directed</jats:italic> case.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Public libraries are popular gathering places, so understanding the factors that contribute to colony-forming unit (CFU) concentrations and how to minimize them is essential. This study aimed to investigate the factors that affect CFU concentrations in a public library, using air sampling (Bioluminescent ATP-assay) and statistical analysis software (SPSS) to collect and analyze data. The findings indicated that the CFU concentration in the library was significantly influenced by the air quality surrounding the building, the number of library visitors, and the hygiene and health of both visitors and employees. Additionally, indoor temperature and humidity were found to be key factors affecting CFU concentration. These findings suggest the need for better ventilation and air filtration systems, as well as regular cleaning and disinfection in public libraries. Furthermore, research is recommended to investigate other potential factors that may impact indoor air quality in public spaces.</jats:p>",

        "year": 2018,
        "abstract": "<jats:p>Unpaired image translation is a challenging problem in computer vision, while existing generative adversarial networks (GANs) models mainly use the adversarial loss and other constraints to model. But the degree of constraint imposed on the generator and the discriminator is not enough, which results in bad image quality. In addition, we find that the current GANs-based models have not yet been implemented by adding an auxiliary domain, which is used to constrain the generator. To solve the problem mentioned above, we propose a multiscale and multilevel GANs (MMGANs) model for image translation. In this model, we add an auxiliary domain to constrain generator, which combines this auxiliary domain with the original domains for modelling and helps generator learn the detailed content of the image. Then we use multiscale and multilevel feature matching to constrain the discriminator. The purpose is to make the training process as stable as possible. Finally, we conduct experiments on six image translation tasks. The results verify the validity of the proposed model.</jats:p>",

To do this, this paper defines some new operations on interval-valued hesitant fuzzy elements, which eliminate the disadvantages of the existing operations. Considering the fact that elements in a set may be interdependent, two generalized interval-valued hesitant fuzzy operators based on the generalized Shapley function and the Choquet integral are defined. Then, some models for calculating the optimal fuzzy measures on the expert set and the ordered position set are established. Because fuzzy measures are defined on the power set, it makes the problem exponentially complex. To simplify the complexity of solving a fuzzy measure, models for the optimal 2-additive measures are constructed. Finally, an investment problem is offered to show the practicality and efficiency of the new method.</jats:p>",

In light of local resources and environmental constraints, it is important to clarify the mode of industrial transfer for Xiong\u2019an new area (XNA) to achieve the developmental goals. This study simulates and analyzes the speed of industrial transfer and the capacities of XNA in light of resource and environmental constraints. The results show that, to just realize modernization in 2035, the transfer rate of the secondary industry and tertiary industry is annually 3.7 billion yuan and 6.4 billion yuan, respectively. But at this speed, the atmospheric environment will be overloaded by 2028. The minimum and maximum transfer rate to realize modernization in 2035 without overloading resources and environment are also specified as well as the total size of economy and population. The results indicate that land for the construction of XNA is rich, but local water is not sufficient to support industrial growth. The atmospheric environment of XNA is also an important limiting factor. It is thus necessary to reduce air pollution and increase the population and industrial scale of the area by increasing the transfer rate of the tertiary industry.</jats:p>",

Firstly, comparing with the traditional event-triggered scheme, a hybrid-driven mechanism is employed in networked control systems (NCSs) for the finite capacity of communication bandwidth resources and system performance in equilibrium. Then, the quantization technology is applied in the communication channel from sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator. The application of BCQ is for further investigation that mitigate data packet transmission rate. Thirdly, Markov jump system is modeled for the hybrid-driven mechanism and network-induced delay. By constructing the Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii function, a sufficient condition is derived as the stability criterion, and the controller is designed in which the nonlinear term is rewritten for simplifying the calculation.

Currently, in the context of learning control, there is a lack of research results about such general class of nonlinear systems, especially for the case of performing infinite interval tasks. This article focuses on the incremental adaptive control for nonlinear systems in nonaffine form, without requiring periodicity or repeatability. Instead of using the integral adaptation, incremental adaptive mechanisms are developed and the corresponding control schemes are presented, by which the numerical integration for implementation can be avoided. With the proposed incremental adaptation, the implicit function theorem is introduced to solve the intractability problem of the nonaffine structure. The robustness (robust convergence) of the tracking error is characterized, with the aid of a proposed key lemma, while the boundedness of all the variables is examined. Numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control design.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>In the realistic world, various individuals have distinct personalities, preferences, and attitudes toward new information and behavior acceptance, called population heterogeneity. It is seldom taken into account and theoretically analyzed in information propagation on a weighted network. Therefore, we divide individuals into fashionable and conservative individuals according to their passion degree and willingness for novel behaviors acceptance. Then, we build two behavior adoption threshold models corresponding to fashionable and conservative individuals on the weighted network to explore the effect of population heterogeneity on information propagation. Next, a partition theory based on edge weight and population heterogeneity is proposed to qualitatively analyze the information propagation mechanism. The theoretical analyses and simulation results show that fashionable individuals promote information propagation and behavior adoption. More importantly, the crossover phenomena of phase transition appear. When the fraction of fashionable individuals is relatively large, the increasing pattern of the final adoption size shows a second-order continuous phase transition. In comparison, the increasing pattern alters to first-order discontinuous phase transition with the decrease of the fraction of fashionable individuals. Moreover, reducing weight distribution heterogeneity promotes information propagation and slightly accelerates the change of the phase transition pattern from the first-order discontinuous to the second-order continuous. Besides, increasing the degree distribution heterogeneity accelerates the change of the phase transition pattern. Finally, our theoretical analyses coincide well with the simulation results.</jats:p>",

However, the current marketing strategy has gradually failed to meet the needs of corporates. In order to find the best solution for corporate marketing strategy, we built a simulation environment based on mobile computing and machine learning and compared the differences by simulating several companies of the same size in this city (corporate efficiency and revenue and expenditure under the marketing strategy). The results of the study found that intelligent marketing based on machine learning is more suitable for enterprises than general marketing strategies.

This phenomenon is well established and is known as thermoelectric power generation. Here, it is shown that, instead, the causal and linear relationship between \u0394V(t) and \u0394T(t) is lost when continuous broadband infrared (CB\u2010IR) radiation illuminates a bi\u2010junction power generator in an insulated compartment. The observed phenomenon is IR power generation. Heat transfer calculations fail in explaining the experimental trends. The interaction between CB\u2010IR radiation and the charge carriers in the bi\u2010junction power generator might play a role in the \u0394V(t) production, depending upon the geometry of the experimental setup. The longitudinal propagation of collective oscillations, for example, polaritons, in the plates protecting the \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d junctions of the bi\u2010junction power generator could explain the \u0394V(t) production and the characteristic time constants.

The new model is validated by the analytical solution and experimental data on three cases of grouting in the parallel-plate fracture. Compared with the results from ANSYS-Fluent software, the present model shows better agreement with the analytical solution for the distribution of pressure and velocity. Furthermore, the new model needs less grid unit, spends less time, but achieves greater accuracy. The complexity of the grout flow field in the rock fracture is reduced; thus the computational efficiency can be improved significantly.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Electric vehicles have become the main contributor in terms of reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emission. Although the government is vigorously promoting the use of electric vehicles worldwide, the range anxiety still impedes the rapid development of electric vehicles, especially when air-conditioning also adds battery power consumption and aggravates the range anxiety. To this end, this paper proposes an improved vehicle-mounted photovoltaic system energy management in intelligent transportation systems, which is a maximum power point tracking control system. Meanwhile, since the power of solar panels is usually relatively small and the power changes at any time, low power density and poor controllability are difficult to avoid. In order to solve this problem, this paper offers a tracking control method to improve the output efficiency of solar panels. For improving photovoltaic conversion efficiency and maximizing output power, traditional photovoltaic power panels are often dominated by a centralized maximum power point tracing control, which is named MPPT. Although the cost under this case is lower, the output power of all photovoltaic panels cannot be maximized under the condition of uneven illumination or local mismatch. To improve the situation, a micro-scale inverter is proposed to provide MPPT control of photovoltaic modules, which can effectively improve the output power of each photovoltaic panel. Moreover, our MPPT algorithm is applicable to cloud shadow, building shadow, and shade, and it is more suitable for the car roof. Firstly, the Diode 5-parameter model is used to deduce the I-U equation of the photovoltaic module considering shadow shading, and then the real-time 5 parameter equation is formed by using the measured data group and selected. The reasonable initial value is used to iteratively solve the real-time value of 5 parameters, which is further to judge the masking situation. The maximum power point (MPP) is solved directly by the mathematical method based on the mathematical model of I-U relation mathematics, and the DC-DC circuit is used to adjust the running point to MPP. Unlike the traditional MPPT method, the method in this paper is based on the physical model of solar cells, and MPP tracking is based on mathematical methods. Based on this, it does not need to cause multiple interference to the circuit, and the tracking efficiency is high. Finally, the relative experimental results are provided to verify the performance of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

During the maintenance process, structural refactoring is performed by remodularizing the source code. Software clustering is a modularization technique to remodularize artifacts of source code aiming to improve readability and reusability. Due to the NP hardness of the clustering problem, evolutionary approaches such as the genetic algorithm have been used to solve this problem. In the structural refactoring literature, there exists no search-based algorithm that employs a hierarchical approach for modularization. Utilizing global and local search strategies, in this paper, a new search-based top-down hierarchical clustering approach, named TDHC, is proposed that can be used to modularize the system. The output of the algorithm is a tree in which each node is an artifact composed of all artifacts in its subtrees and is a candidate to be a software module (i.e., cluster). This tree helps a software maintainer to have better vision on source code structure to decide appropriate composition points of artifacts aiming to create modules (i.e., files, packages, and components). Experimental results on seven folders of Mozilla Firefox with different functionalities and five other software systems show that the TDHC produces modularization closer to the human expert\u2019s decomposition (i.e., directory structure) than the other existing algorithms.

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Recommender systems have become indispensable for online services since they alleviate the information overload problem for users. Some work has been proposed to support the personalized recommendation by utilizing collaborative filtering to learn the latent user and item representations from implicit interactions between users and items. However, most of existing methods simplify the implicit frequency feedback to binary values, which make collaborative filtering unable to accurately learn the latent user and item features. Moreover, the traditional collaborating filtering methods generally use the linear functions to model the interactions between latent features. The expressiveness of linear functions may not be sufficient to capture the complex structure of users\u2019 interactions and degrades the performance of those recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a neural personalized ranking model for collaborative filtering with the implicit frequency feedback. The proposed method integrates the ranking-based poisson factor model into the neural networks. Specifically, we firstly develop a ranking-based poisson factor model, which combines the poisson factor model and the Bayesian personalized ranking. This model adopts a pair-wise learning method to learn the rankings of uses\u2019 preferences between items. After that, we propose a neural personalized ranking model on top of the ranking-based poisson factor model, named NRPFM, to capture the complex structure of user-item interactions. NRPFM applies the ranking-based poisson factor model on neural networks, which endows the linear ranking-based poisson factor model with a high level of nonlinearities. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our proposed method compares favorably with the state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.</jats:p>",

        "year": 2018,
        "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasing complexity of projects is mentioned as one of the reasons for project failure\u2014still. This paper presents a comparative research to investigate how project complexity was perceived by project practitioners in different industry sectors. Five sectors were included: process industry, construction industry, ICT, high-tech product development, and food processing industry. In total, more than 140 projects were included in the research, hence providing a broad view on Dutch project practice. From the complexity assessments, it is concluded that only one complexity element was present in the top complexity elements of projects across the five sectors: the high project schedule drive. The variety of external stakeholders\u2019 perspectives, a lack of resources and skills availability, and interference with existing site were found in the top lists of three sectors. It was concluded that a framework to grasp project complexity could support the management of complex projects by creating awareness for the (expected) complexities. Further research could be focused on the subjective character of complexity as well as on the application of cross-sector learning, since this research does show similarities between large technical projects in different sectors.</jats:p>",

        "year": 2017,
        "abstract": "<jats:p>It is well known that most brain disorders are complex diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). In general, brain regions and their interactions can be modeled as complex brain network, which describe highly efficient information transmission in a brain. Therefore, complex brain network analysis plays an important role in the study of complex brain diseases. With the development of noninvasive neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques, experimental data can be produced for constructing complex brain networks. In recent years, researchers have found that brain networks constructed by using neuroimaging data and electrophysiological data have many important topological properties, such as small-world property, modularity, and rich club. More importantly, many brain disorders have been found to be associated with the abnormal topological structures of brain networks. These findings provide not only a new perspective to explore the pathological mechanisms of brain disorders, but also guidance for early diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. The purpose of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview for complex brain network analysis and its applications to brain disorders.</jats:p>",

        "doi": "10.1155/2019/1715624",
        "year": 2019,
        "abstract": "<jats:p>The unexplained and inconsistent behavior of financial markets provides the motivation to engage interdisciplinary approaches to understand its intricacies better. A proven approach is to consider investors as heterogeneous interacting agents who form information networks to inform their investment decisions. The rationale is that the topology of these networks has contributed to a better understanding of the erratic behavior of financial markets. Introducing investor heterogeneity also allows researchers to identify the characteristics of higher performing investors and the implications of investors exhibiting short-termism, a feature recognized by some as detrimental to the performance of the economy. To address these topics, an agent-based artificial stock market is implemented, where investors utilize various information sources, including advice from investors in their network, to inform their investment decisions. Over time investors update their trust in their information sources and evolve their network by connecting to outperforming investors\u2014Oracles\u2014and discarding poor advisers, thereby simulating the evolution of an investor network. The model\u2019s most significant finding is uncovering how the market\u2019s behavior is materially affected by the time-horizon of investors, with short-term behavior resulting in greater volatility in the market. Another finding is the reason why short-term investors generally outperform their long-term counterparts, particularly in more volatile environments. By providing significant insights into the formation of an investor network and its ramifications for market volatility and wealth creation (destruction), this paper provides crucial clues regarding the empirical data that needs to be collected, assessed, and tracked to ensure policymakers and investors better understand the dynamics of financial markets.</jats:p>",

        "year": 2022,
        "abstract": "<jats:p>Green innovation is widely regarded as a beneficial strategy for manufacturing enterprises to accelerate green transformation. Drawing the natural resource-based view with dynamic capabilities, this study proposes a model linking green innovation, green dynamic capability, and firm performance. Using survey data from 236 heavy polluting manufacturing firms in China, this study investigates the impact of green innovation on firm performance. The results show that green innovation is positively correlated with both enterprise performance and green dynamic capability, whereas green dynamic capability also has a significant impact on enterprise performance. Furthermore, the survey found that the green resource integration ability, organizational learning capability, and environmental insight capability of green dynamic capability play a moderating effect on the relationship between green innovation and enterprise performance. Additionally, we provide useful enlightenment for policymakers and business managers to stimulate green innovation in enterprises. Our research not only assists managers to better grasp the effects of green innovation practices but also provides some important implications for policymakers.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last few years, a new methodology to address the P versus NP problem has been developed, based on searching for borderlines between the nonefficiency of computing models (only problems in class P can be solved in polynomial time) and the presumed efficiency (ability to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time). These borderlines can be seen as frontiers of efficiency, which are crucial in this methodology. \u201cTranslating,\u201d in some sense, an efficient solution in a presumably efficient model to an efficient solution in a nonefficient model would give an affirmative answer to problem P versus NP. In the framework of Membrane Computing, the key of this approach is to detect the syntactic or semantic ingredients that are needed to pass from a nonefficient class of membrane systems to a presumably efficient one. This paper deals with tissue P systems with communication rules of type symport/antiport allowing the evolution of the objects triggering the rules. In previous works, frontiers of efficiency were found in these kinds of membrane systems both with division rules and with separation rules. However, since they were not optimal, it is interesting to refine these frontiers. In this work, optimal frontiers of the efficiency are obtained in terms of the total number of objects involved in the communication rules used for that kind of membrane systems. These optimizations could be easier to translate, if possible, to efficient solutions in a nonefficient model.</jats:p>",
