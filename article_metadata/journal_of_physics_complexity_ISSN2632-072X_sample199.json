In particular, the asymptotic codimension of the set of initial conditions of non-escaping particles is zero rather than one and the time-dependent escape rates either undergo an exponential decay rather than growth (for moderate and fast energy dissipation) or display a complex, possibly nonmonotonic behavior (for slow energy dissipation).</jats:p>",

Local changes in the underlying dynamics may affect the whole network and, in the worst case, cause a total collapse of the system through a cascading failure. It has been demonstrated that certain subgraphs can reduce failure spreading drastically, or even inhibit it completely. However, this shielding effect is poorly understood for non-linear dynamical models. Here, we study the effect of perturbations in networks of oscillators coupled via the Kuramoto model. We demonstrate how the network structure can be optimised for suppressing specific, targeted fluctuations at a desired operational state while letting others pass. We illustrate our approach by demonstrating that a significant reduction in time-dependent fluctuations may be achieved by optimising the edge weights. Finally, we demonstrate how to apply the developed method to real-world supply networks such as power grids. Our findings reveal that a targeted shielding of specific solutions in multistable systems is possible which may be applied to make supply networks more robust.</jats:p>",

It is the process of creating more complex technologies, ideas, or protocols from existing ones. While innovation may be created by single agents (i.e. individuals or organisations), it is often a result of social interactions between agents exchanging and combining complementary expertise and perspectives. The structure of social networks impacts this knowledge exchange process. To study the role of social network structures on the creation of new technologies, we design an evolutionary mechanistic model combining self-creation and social learning. We find that social heterogeneity allows agents to leverage the benefits of diversity and to develop technologies of higher complexity. Social heterogeneity, however, reduces the group ability to innovate. Not only the social structure but also the openness of agents to collaborate affect innovation. We find that interdisciplinary interactions lead to more complex technologies benefiting the entire group but also increase the inequality in the innovation output. Lower openness to interdisciplinary collaborations may be compensated by a higher ability to collaborate with multiple peers, but low openness also neutralises the intrinsic benefits of network heterogeneity. Our findings indicate that social network heterogeneity has contrasting effects on microscopic (local) and macroscopic (group) levels, suggesting that the emergence of innovation leaders may suppress the overall group performance.</jats:p>",

The numerical simulations revealed that certain networks (e.g., globally coupled or dense Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random networks) showed relatively simple behavior with monotonic increase of the Kuramoto order parameter from the random initial condition to the fully synchronized state and that the transient times exhibited a unimodal distribution. However, some modular networks with bridge elements were identified which exhibited non-monotonic variation of the order parameter with local maximum and/or minimum. In these networks, the histogram of the transients times became bimodal and the mean transient time scaled well with inverse of the magnitude of the second largest eigenvalue of the network Laplacian matrix. The non-monotonic transients increase the relative standard deviations from about 0.3 to 0.5, i.e., the transient times became more diverse. The non-monotonic transients are related to generation of phase patterns where the modules are synchronized but approximately anti-phase to each other. The predictions of the numerical simulations were demonstrated in a population of coupled oscillatory electrochemical reactions in global, modular, and irregular tree networks. The findings clarify the role of network structure in generation of complex transients that can, for example, play a role in intermittent desynchronization of the circadian clock due to external cues or in deep brain stimulations where long transients are required after a desynchronization stimulus.</jats:p>",

The combination of recurrent and driving external inputs must therefore lead to a non-trivial stationary neural activity, a condition which is fulfiled for afferent signals of varying strengths only close to criticality. In this view, the benefits of working in the vicinity of a second-order phase transition, such as signal enhancements, are not the underlying evolutionary drivers, but side effects of the requirement to keep the brain functional in first place.

Here, we extracted the state of the road network of Manila, Philippines at various points in history through georeferencing and digitization of hand-drawn historical maps. Visual and metrical analyses revealed key well-planned periods punctuating the otherwise self-organized growth, particularly the more recent densification at reclamation areas coincident with the rapid economic growth. The road network of Manila shows statistical regularities that are also observed for other global road network data sets, although the recent reclamation significantly increase the statistics of the very short and peripheral nodes. Finally, the clusters of nodes with the highest closeness centralities mimic the historical shape of the network, allowing for an automatic identification of the core historical sections of the city.

We quantify the complexity of these ground states, and their response to the attacks, by calculating distributions of network measures of an emergent network whose link weights are the pairwise mutual information between spins. We focus on attacks which projectively measure spins. We find that the emergent networks in the ground state do not satisfy the usual criteria for complexity, and their average properties are captured well by a single dimensionless parameter in the Hamiltonian. While the response of classical networks to attacks is well-studied, where classical complex networks are known to be more robust to random attacks than random networks, we find counter-intuitive results for our quantum networks. We find that the ground states for Hamiltonians defined on different classes of imprinted networks respond similarly to all our attacks, and the attacks rescale the average properties of the emergent network by a constant factor. Mean field theory explains these results for relatively dense networks, but we also find the simple rescaling behavior away from the regime of validity of mean field theory. Our calculations indicate that complex spin networks are not more robust to projective measurement attacks, and presumably also other quantum attacks, than non-complex spin networks, in contrast to the classical case. Understanding the response of the spin networks to decoherence and attacks will have applications in understanding the physics of open quantum systems, and in designing robust complex quantum systems\u2014possibly even a robust quantum internet in the long run\u2014that is maximally resistant to decoherence.</jats:p>",

While most network evolutionary models can provide an iterative process for constructing global properties, they cannot capture the evolutionary mechanisms of real systems. Link prediction is hence proposed to predict future links which also can help us understand the evolution law of real systems. The aim of link prediction is to uncover missing links from known parts of the network or quantify the likelihood of the emergence of future links from current structures of the network. However, almost all existing studies ignored that old nodes tend to disappear and new nodes appear over time in real networks, especially in social networks. It is more challenging for link prediction since the new nodes do not have pre-existing structure information. To solve the temporal link prediction problems with new nodes, here we take into account nodal attribute similarity and the shortest path length, namely, ASSPL, to predict future links with new nodes. The results tested on scholar social network and academic funding networks show that it is highly effective and applicable for ASSPL in funding networks with time-evolving. Meanwhile, we make full use of an efficient parameter to exploit how network structure or nodal attribute has an impact on the performance of temporal link prediction. Finally, we find that nodal attributes and network structure complement each other well for predicting future links with new nodes in funding networks.</jats:p>",

Particular interest has been devoted to extend the stochastic block model and its variant, to capture community structure as the network changes in time. While these models assume that edge formation depends only on the community memberships, recent work for static networks show the importance to include additional parameters capturing structural properties, as reciprocity for instance. Remarkably, these models are capable of generating more realistic network representations than those that only consider community membership. To this aim, we present a probabilistic generative model with hidden variables that integrates reciprocity and communities as structural information of networks that evolve in time. The model assumes a fundamental order in observing reciprocal data, that is an edge is observed, conditional on its reciprocated edge in the past. We deploy a Markovian approach to construct the network\u2019s transition matrix between time steps and parameters\u2019 inference is performed with an expectation-maximization algorithm that leads to high computational efficiency because it exploits the sparsity of the dataset.

Here we propose a methodology to mine outliers in generic datasets in which it is possible to define a meaningful distance between elements of the dataset. The methodology is based on defining a fully connected, undirected graph, where the nodes are the elements of the dataset and the links have weights that are the distances between the nodes. Outlier scores are defined by analyzing the structure of the graph, in particular, by using the Jensen\u2013Shannon (JS) divergence to compare the distributions of weights of different nodes. We demonstrate the method using a publicly available database of credit-card transactions, where some of the transactions are labeled as frauds. We compare with the performance obtained when using Euclidean distances and graph percolation, and show that the JS divergence leads to performance improvement, but increases the computational cost.</jats:p>",

Specifically, we show that the RSC contains at least one sub-population capable of switching between two different SF regimes, indicating an intricate relationship between behavior and the optimality of neuronal response at the subgroup level.

However, they vanish faster, over short distances if the noise fluctuates rapidly. We furthermore demonstrate that a Berry\u2013Esseen theorem leads to the vanishing of non-Gaussianities as the number of uncorrelated noise sources increases.

Algorithms require increasing computational resources from this critical point. This is a so called, algorithmic or computational phase transition and has extensively been studied. In this paper we consider the complexity in sampling and recovering ground states from resultant distributions of a physics based processor. In particular, we first consider the ideal Gibbs distributions at some fixed inverse temperature and observe that the success probability in sampling and recovering ground states decrease for instances starting at the critical density. Furthermore, simulating the Gibbs distribution, we employ Ising spin dynamics, which play a crucial role in understanding of non-equilibrium statistical physics, to find their steady states of 2-SAT Hamiltonians. We observe that beyond the critical density, the probability of sampling ground states decreases. Our results apply to several contemporary devices and provide a means to experimentally probe a signature of the computational phase transition.</jats:p>",

We construct an equivalent model of an exponential network and study its structural changes with changes in two parameters related to redundancy and dead-ends. Then we analyze its stability against cascading failures by varying these two parameters using the link failure model. This helps to gain insight into the relation of network topology to its stability, and indicates how the optimum choice of these parameters can result in a power grid structure with minimum failed links. We apply the same model to study the robustness of the Indian power grid against such failures. In this case, we find that when a link connected to a generator fails, it results in a cascade that spreads in the grid until it is split into two separate stable clusters of generators and consumers, with over one-third of its nodes nonfunctional.</jats:p>",

This paper is concerned with the integration of deterministic and stochastic processes within an information theoretic framework, linking information entropy and free energy to mechanisms of emergent dynamics and self-organization in brain networks. We identify basic properties of neuronal populations leading to an equivariant matrix in a network, in which complex behaviors can naturally be represented through structured flows on manifolds establishing the internal model relevant to theories of brain function. We propose a neural mechanism for the generation of internal models from symmetry breaking in the connectivity of brain networks.

How to avert the TOC is a significant problem related to the conservation of resources. It is not hard to envisage situations where the resource could be self-renewing and the size of the population may be dependent on the state of the resource through the fractions of the population employing different exploitation rates. If the self-renewal rate of the resource lies between the maximum and the minimum exploitation rates, it is not <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> obvious under what conditions the TOC can be averted.

Thus, it is an interesting question that how reward and punishment comparatively fare in averting the tragedy of the common (TOC) in the game-resource feedback evolutionary dynamics. Our main finding is that, while averting the TOC completely, rewarding cooperators cannot get rid of all the defectors, unlike what happens when defectors are punished; and as a consequence, in the completely replete resource state, the outcome of the population game can be socially optimal in the presence of the punishment but not so in the presence of the reward.</jats:p>",

Human beings revolve around these fears of uncertainties concerning various aspects like a global pandemic, health, finances, to name but a few. Dealing with this unavoidable part of life is far tougher due to the chaotic nature of these unpredictable activities. In the present article, we consider a global network of identical chaotic maps, which splits into two different clusters, despite the interaction between all nodes are uniform. The stability analysis of the spatially homogeneous chaotic solutions provides a critical coupling strength, before which we anticipate such partial synchronization. The distance between these two chaotic synchronized populations often deviates more than eight times of standard deviation from its long-term average. The probability density function of these highly deviated values fits well with the generalized extreme value distribution. Meanwhile, the distribution of recurrence time intervals between extreme events resembles the Weibull distribution. The existing literature helps us to characterize such events as extreme events using the significant height. These extremely high fluctuations are less frequent in terms of their occurrence. We determine numerically a range of coupling strength for these extremely large but recurrent events. On-off intermittency is the responsible mechanism underlying the formation of such extreme events. Besides understanding the generation of such extreme events and their statistical signature, we furnish forecasting these events using the powerful deep learning algorithms of an artificial recurrent neural network. This long short-term memory (LSTM) can offer handy one-step forecasting of these chaotic intermittent bursts.

The tool of random matrices is adapted to add an explicit varietal growth, through an \u2018inflation\u2019 of a real random matrix (Ginibre set), by regularly adding a line and a column, such a matrix operating at each unit time step on the evolving vector, <jats:italic>U</jats:italic>(<jats:italic>t</jats:italic> + 1) = <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>(<jats:italic>t</jats:italic>)<jats:italic>U</jats:italic>(<jats:italic>t</jats:italic>).

In some cases, the eigenvector corresponding to the second highest eigenvalue yields a pacemaker region whose calcium signals predict the AP. Furthermore, using new analytic methods, we study the relationship between covariance coefficients and distance, and find that even inside the central zone, there are non-trivial long range correlations, indicating intercellular interactions in most cases. Lastly, we perform an analysis of nearest-neighbour eigenvalue distances and find that it coincides with universal Wigner surmise under all available experimental conditions, while the number variance, which captures eigenvalue correlations, is sensitive to experimental conditions. Thus RMT application to SAN allows to remove noise and the global effects of the AP-induced calcium transient and thereby isolate the local and meaningful correlations in calcium signalling.</jats:p>",

Such a modeling framework, however, is naturally limited to pairwise interactions, making it less suitable to properly describe social contagion, where individuals acquire new norms or ideas after simultaneous exposure to multiple sources of infections. Simplicial contagion has been proposed as an alternative framework where simplices are used to encode group interactions of any order. The presence of these higher-order interactions leads to explosive epidemic transitions and bistability. In particular, critical mass effects can emerge even for infectivity values below the standard pairwise epidemic threshold, where the size of the initial seed of infectious nodes determines whether the system would eventually fall in the endemic or the healthy state. Here we extend simplicial contagion to time-varying networks, where pairwise and higher-order simplices can be created or destroyed over time. By following a microscopic Markov chain approach, we find that the same seed of infectious nodes might or might not lead to an endemic stationary state, depending on the temporal properties of the underlying network structure, and show that persistent temporal interactions anticipate the onset of the endemic state in finite-size systems. We characterize this behavior on higher-order networks with a prescribed temporal correlation between consecutive interactions and on heterogeneous simplicial complexes, showing that temporality again limits the effect of higher-order spreading, but in a less pronounced way than for homogeneous structures. Our work suggests the importance of incorporating temporality, a realistic feature of many real-world systems, into the investigation of dynamical processes beyond pairwise interactions.</jats:p>",

We demonstrate how the approach proposed here for the multifractal analysis of irregular marked point processes is able to estimate local self-similarity and intermittency exponents in a satisfactory manner via combining methods from classical multifractal and geographical analysis. With the aim of emphasizing general applicability, we first introduce the procedure on synthetic data using a multifractal random field as mark superposed on two distinct spatial distributions. We go on to illustrate the methodology on the example of home prices in the greater Paris region, France. In the context of complex urban systems, our findings proclaim the need for separately tackling processes on the geolocation (support) and any attached value (mark, e.g. home prices) of geospatial data points in an attempt to fully describe the phenomenon under observation. In particular, the results are indicators of the strength of global and local spatial dependency in the housing price structure and how these build distinct layered patterns within and outside of the municipal boundary. The derived properties are of potential urban policy and strategic planning relevance for the timely identification of local vulnerabilities while they are also intended to be combinable with existing price indices in the regional economics context.</jats:p>",

The recent availability of large amounts of data allows us to envision the construction of new approaches for understanding this coupling between transport and population growth. Here, we use a detailed dataset for about 36\u2009000 municipalities in France from 1968 until now. In the case of large urban areas such as Paris, we show that growth rate statistical variations decay in time and display a trend towards homogenization where local aspects are less relevant. We also show that growth rate differences due to accessibility are very small and can mostly be observed for cities that experienced very large accessibility variations. This suggests that the relevant variable for explaining growth rate variations is not the accessibility but its temporal variation. We propose a model that integrates the stochastic internal variation of the municipalities population and an inter-urban migration term that we show to be proportional to the accessibility variation and has a limited time duration. This model provides a simple theoretical framework that allows to go beyond econometric studies and sheds a new light on the impact of transportation modes on city growth.</jats:p>",

While for weak coupling the variables are still distributed following power-law functions, their distributions are severely distorted as interactions become stronger, with sudden appearance of cutoffs and divergent singularities. We explore these effects both analytically and numerically, for coupled ensembles of identical and non-identical variables. The most relevant consequences of ensemble heterogeneity are assessed, and preliminary results for spatially distributed ensembles are presented.</jats:p>",

Such decision making circuits need to respond to the external world in efficient and flexible ways, and one potentially general mechanism of achieving this is grounded in critical states. Mounting evidence has shown that brains operate close to such critical boundaries consistent with self-organized criticality (SOC). Is this also taking place in small-scale living systems, such as cells? Here, we explore a recent model of engineered gene networks that have been shown to exploit the feedback between order and control parameters (as defined by expression levels of two coupled genes) to achieve an SOC state. We suggest that such SOC motif could be exploited to generate adaptive behavioral patterns and might help design\u00a0fast responses in synthetic cellular and multicellular organisms.</jats:p>",

The filtering mechanism, present in many online social platforms, reduces individuals\u2019 exposure to disagreeing opinions, producing algorithmic bias. We derive evolution equations for global opinion variables in the presence of algorithmic bias, network community structure, noise (independent behavior of individuals), and pairwise or group interactions. We consider the case where the social platform shows a predilection for one opinion over its opposite, unbalancing the dynamics in favor of that opinion. We show that if the imbalance is strong enough, it may determine the final global opinion and the dynamical behavior of the population. We find a complex phase diagram including phases of coexistence, consensus, and polarization of opinions as possible final states of the model, with phase transitions of different order between them. The fixed point\u00a0structure of the equations determines the dynamics to a large extent. We focus on the time needed for convergence and conclude that this quantity varies within a wide range, showing occasionally signatures of critical slowing down and meta-stability.</jats:p>",

However, it relates to the issues like public opinion management, knowledge diffusion, and innovation. In this paper, we assume that the interests of a group of online users can span an Euclidean space which is called interest space, and the transfers of user interests can be modelled as L\u00e9vy Flight in the interest space. Considering the interaction between users, we assume that the random walkers are not independent but interacting with each other indirectly via the digital resources in the interest space. The proposed model in this paper successfully reproduced a set of scaling laws for describing the growth of attention flow networks of online communities, and obtaining similar ranges of users\u2019 scaling exponents with empirical data. Further, we inferred parameters for describing the individual behaviours of the users according to the scaling laws of empirical attention flow network. Our model can not only provide theoretical understanding of human online behaviours but also has broad potential applications such as dissemination and public opinion management, online recommendation, etc.</jats:p>",

Theoretically super-diffusion was only known to be predicted using the spectral gap of the full Laplacian of a multiplex network and its interacting layers. Here we turn to machine learning (ML) which has developed techniques to recognize, classify, and characterize complex sets of data. We show that modern ML architectures, such as fully connected and convolutional neural networks (CNN), can classify and predict the presence of super-diffusion in multiplex networks with 94.12% accuracy.

In this article, we establish a model for the emergence of trade networks that is based on rational decisions of individual agents. The model incorporates key drivers for the emergence of trade, comparative advantage and economic scale effects, but also the heterogeneity of agents and the transportation or transaction costs. Numerical simulations show three macroscopically different regimes of the emerging trade networks. Depending on the specific transportation costs and the heterogeneity of individual preferences, we find centralized production with a star-like trade network, distributed production with all-to-all trading or local production and no trade. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we provide an analytic theory of the transitions between these regimes and estimates for critical parameters values.</jats:p>",

To support this challenge, existing theory focuses on predicting whether a delay in completing a single activity is likely to spread and impact downstream activities. Using fine-grained information from 68\u2009546 activities and 84\u2009934 pairs, associated with the delivery of a $1.86Bn infrastructure project, we show that the core mechanism that underpins existing theory underestimates delay propagation. To elucidate the mechanisms that drive delay, we generated null models that destroyed the structural and temporal correlations of the original project activity network. By doing so, we argue that this underestimation is the result of neglecting endogenous structural features within the project\u2019s activity network. Formulating a new mechanism that utilizes both temporal and structural features may help improve our capacity to predict how delays spread within projects.</jats:p>",

At the clustering transition, the graphs change from typically having only isolated cycles to forming cycle clusters. At the shattering transition the graphs break up into many small cliques to achieve the desired three-cycle density. The locations of both transitions depend nontrivially on the system size. We derive a general formula for the three-cycle density in the regime of isolated cycles, for graphs with degree distributions that have finite first and second moments. For bounded degree distributions we present further analytical results on cycle densities and phase transition locations, which, while non-rigorous, are all validated via MCMC sampling simulations. We show that the shattering transition is of an entropic nature, occurring for all three-cycle density values, provided the system is large enough.</jats:p>",

Multiplex networks are adopted for modelling a wide variety of real-world frameworks, such as multi-type relations in social, economic and biological structures. More specifically, multiplex networks are used when relations of different nature (layers) arise between a set of elements from a given population (nodes). A possible approach for analyzing multiplex similarity networks consists in aggregating the different layers in a single network (monoplex) which is a valid representation\u2014in some sense\u2014of all the layers. In order to obtain such an aggregated network, we propose a theoretical approach\u2014along with its practical implementation\u2014which stems on the concept of similarity matrix average. This methodology is finally applied to a multiplex similarity network of statistical journals, where the three considered layers express the similarity of the journals based on co-citations, common authors and common editors, respectively.</jats:p>",

Reward is a powerful motivator to promote the evolution of cooperation, thus addressing the social dilemma. Nevertheless, it is costly since we need to monitor all participants in the game. Inspired by these observations, we here propose an inexpensive protocol, a so-called sampling reward mechanism, and apply it to social dilemmas, including public goods game and collective-risk social dilemma. More precisely, the actual usage of reward depends on the portion of cooperators in the sample. We show that the average cooperation level can be effectively improved under high reward threshold and high reward intensity, albeit at the expense of reward cost. It is intriguing to discover that for the latter aspect, there is a critical threshold at which further increases in reward intensity have no significant effect on improving the cooperation level. Moreover, we find that the small sample size favors the evolution of cooperation while an intermediate sample size always results in a lower reward cost. We also demonstrate that our findings are robust and remain valid for both types of social dilemmas.</jats:p>",

Here we focus on the behavior of Gini index, one of the most used inequality measures, in presence of Zipf\u2019s law, a situation which occurs in many complex financial and economical systems. First, we show that the application of asymptotic formulas to finite size systems always leads to an overestimation of inequality. We thus compute finite size corrections and we show that depending on Zipf\u2019s exponent two distinct regimes can be observed: low inequality, where Gini index is less than one and maximal inequality, where Gini index asymptotically tends to its maximal value one. In both cases, the inequality of an expanding system slowly increases just as effect of growth, with a scaling never faster than the inverse of the size. We test our computations on two real systems, US cities and the cryptocurrency market, observing in both cases an increase of inequality that is completely explained by Zipf\u2019s law and the systems expanding. This shows that in growing complex systems finite size effects must be considered in order to properly assess if inequality is increasing due to natural growth processes or if it is produced by a change in the economical structure of the systems. Finally we discuss how such effects must be carefully considered when analyzing survey data.</jats:p>",

In present work, a simple model that can perform multiple tasks using a contextual signal was studied, trying to illuminate mechanisms similar to those that could occur in biological brains. Backpropagation through time allows training networks with multitasking, but the realizations obtained are not unique. Different realizations for the same set of tasks are possible. Here the analysis of the dynamics and emergent behavior of their units is presented. The goal is to try to describe better the models used to describe different processes in the cortex.</jats:p>",

The reconstructed backbone network depends upon the accuracy and reliability of the available tools, which, in turn, are affected by the specific features of the available dataset. Here, we examine the performance of three approaches for the discovery of backbone networks, in the presence of heterogeneous, time-varying node properties. In addition to the recently proposed evolving activity driven model, we extend two existing approaches (the disparity filter and the temporal fitness model) to tackle time-varying phenomena. Our analysis focuses on the influence of the network size, which was previously shown to be a determining factor for the performance of the evolving activity driven model. Through mathematical and numerical analysis, we propose general guidelines for the use of these three approaches based on the available dataset. For small networks, the evolving temporal fitness model offers a more reasonable trade-off between the number of links assigned to the backbone network and the accuracy of their inference. The main limitation of this methodology lies in its computational cost, which becomes excessively high for large networks. In this case, the evolving activity driven model could be a valid substitute to the evolving temporal fitness model. If one seeks to minimize the number of links inaccurately included in the backbone network at the risk of dismissing many links that could belong to it, then the temporal disparity filter would be the approach-of-choice. Overall, our contribution expands the toolbox of network discovery in the technical literature and should help users in choosing the right network discovery instrument, depending on the problem considered.</jats:p>",

Ignoring this fact can aggregate connection patterns that exist only at certain scales of interaction. To isolate these scale-dependent patterns, we present an approach for analyzing higher-order datasets by filtering interactions by their size.

When the threshold was low, the students reached the amount of overall contribution necessary to avoid it. But in the case of a high threshold, none of the populations reached the threshold. In fact, they were far from it. In this sense, the collective behavior of the students and of people of relevance was fundamentally the same. The majority of participants in the high-risk case fell into four categories: those who did not contribute (around 10%), those who contribute half of their means (15%) but less than the fair share required to reach the threshold, those who contributed the fair share (10%), and those who contributed everything they had, so that their personal benefit was zero. In the case of students this last percentage was 10%, but in the other sample it reached almost 30%. We also found that individuals could be classified as being optimistic or pessimistic, and in general they behaved accordingly with regard to their contributions. Our results highlight the complexity of mitigating climate change in large groups and specially the difficulty in communicating the issue to foster action in a general population.</jats:p>",

However, in such interactions, arguably the PGG is often nonlinear in nature. This is because the increment in benefit generated, owing to additional cost contributed by the players, is realistically seldom linear. Furthermore, sometimes a social good is created due to interspecific interactions, e.g. in cooperative hunting by animals of two different species. In this paper, we study the evolutionary dynamics of a heterogenous population of cooperators and defectors playing nonlinear PGG; here we define heterogenous population as the one composed of distinct subpopulations with interactions among them. We employ the replicator equations for this investigation, and present the non-trivial effects of nonlinearity and size of the groups involved in the game. We report the possibility of discoordination, and coexistence of coordination and anti-coordination in such nonlinear PGG.</jats:p>",

Through training with measured time series, a reservoir machine can be harnessed to replicate the evolution of the target chaotic system for some amount of time, typically about half dozen Lyapunov times. Recently, we developed a reservoir computing framework with an additional parameter channel for predicting system collapse and chaotic transients associated with crisis. It was found that the crisis point after which transient chaos emerges can be accurately predicted. The idea of adding a parameter channel to reservoir computing has also been used by others to predict bifurcation points and distinct asymptotic behaviors. In this paper, we address three issues associated with machine-generated transient chaos. First, we report the results from a detailed study of the statistical behaviors of transient chaos generated by our parameter-aware reservoir computing machine. When multiple time series from a small number of distinct values of the bifurcation parameter, all in the regime of attracting chaos, are deployed to train the reservoir machine, it can generate the correct dynamical behavior in the regime of transient chaos of the target system in the sense that the basic statistical features of the machine generated transient chaos agree with those of the real system. Second, we demonstrate that our machine learning framework can reproduce intermittency of the target system. Third, we consider a system for which the known methods of sparse optimization fail to predict crisis and demonstrate that our reservoir computing scheme can solve this problem. These findings have potential applications in anticipating system collapse as induced by, e.g., a parameter drift that places the system in a transient regime.</jats:p>",

However, \u2018super-spreading events\u2019 have been found to be power-law distributed, suggesting that the underlying networks may be scale free or at least highly heterogeneous.

A particular case of interest for disease control is the emergence of discontinuous transitions in epidemic dynamics coming from their interactions with other simultaneous processes. To address this problem, here we propose a framework coupling a standard epidemic dynamics with another contagion process, presenting a tunable parameter shaping the nature of its transitions. Our model retrieves well-known results in the literature, such as the existence of first-order transitions arising from the mutual cooperation of epidemics or the onset of abrupt transitions when social contagions unidirectionally drive epidemics. We also reveal that negative feedback loops between simultaneous dynamical processes might suppress abrupt phenomena, thus increasing systems robustness against external perturbations. Our results render a general perspective toward finding different pathways to abrupt phenomena from the interaction of contagion processes.</jats:p>",

Statistically, for the case of finite driving times, we observe that the site-dependent reinforcements decrease the occurrence of very large avalanches, leading to an effective global stabilization. Interestingly, however, long simulation runs indicate that the system will persist in a state of self-organized criticality (SOC), recovering the power-law distributions with a different exponent as the original sandpile. These results suggest that tipping the heavy-tailed power-laws into more equitable and normal statistics may require unrealistic scales of intervention for real-world systems, and that, in the long run, SOC mechanisms still emerge. This may help explain the robustness of power-law statistics for many complex systems.</jats:p>",

By comparing numerical results on Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi and Husimi graphs with sign-antisymmetric interactions or mixed sign patterns, we propose a sufficient criterion, called <jats:italic>strong local sign stability</jats:italic>, for stability not to be affected by system size, as traditionally implied by the complexity-stability trade-off in conventional models of random matrices. The criterion requires sign-antisymmetric or unidirectional interactions and a local structure of the graph such that the number of cycles of finite length do not increase with the system size. Note that the last requirement is stronger than the classical local tree-like condition, which we associate to the less stringent definition of <jats:italic>local sign stability</jats:italic>, also defined in the paper. In addition, for strong local sign stable graphs which show stability to linear perturbations irrespectively of system size, we observe that the leading eigenvalue can undergo a transition from being real to acquiring a nonnull imaginary part, which implies a dynamical transition from nonoscillatory to oscillatory linear response to perturbations.

The utility of this index is shown in three members of a hierarchy of ENSO models: a conceptual box model, the classical Zebiak-Cane model and a state-of-the-art Global Climate Model. Finally, the criticality index is determined from observations, leading to the result that ENSO variability appears to be subcritical.</jats:p>",

How these correlations affect our ability to control systems with time-varying interactions remains unclear. In this work, we use higher-order network models to extend the framework of structural controllability to temporal networks, where the chronological ordering of interactions gives rise to time-respecting paths with non-Markovian characteristics. We study six empirical data sets and show that non-Markovian characteristics of real systems can both increase or decrease the minimum time needed to control the whole system. With both empirical data and synthetic models, we further show that spectral properties of generalisations of graph Laplacians to higher-order networks can be used to analytically capture the effect of temporal correlations on controllability. Our work highlights that (i) correlations in the chronological ordering of interactions are an important source of complexity that significantly influences the controllability of temporal networks, and (ii) higher-order network models are a powerful tool to understand the temporal-topological characteristics of empirical systems.</jats:p>",

Instead, complex functions are created through a broad variety of circuits, each exhibiting an equally varied repertoire of emergent dynamics. How collective dynamics may contribute to computations still is not fully understood to date, even on the most elementary level. Here we provide a concise introduction to bio-inspired computing via nonlinear dynamical systems. We first provide a coarse overview of how the study of biological systems has catalyzed the development of artificial systems in several broad directions.

Networked models of CPR extraction suggest that the flexibility of individual agents to selectively allocate extraction effort among multiple resources plays an important role in maximizing their payoffs. However, empirical evidence suggests that real-world CPR appropriators may often de-emphasize issues of allocation, for example by responding to the degradation of a single resource by reducing extraction from multiple resources, rather than by reallocating extraction effort away from the degraded resource. Here, we study the population-level consequences that emerge when individuals are constrained to apply an equal amount of extraction effort to all CPRs that are available to them within an affiliation network linking agents to resources. In systems where all resources have the same capacity, this uniform-allocation constraint leads to reduced collective wealth compared to unconstrained best-response extraction, but it can produce more egalitarian wealth distributions. The differences are more pronounced in networks that have higher degree heterogeneity among resources. In the case that the capacity of each CPR is proportional to its number of appropriators, the uniform-allocation constraint can lead to more efficient collective extraction since it serves to distribute the burden of over-extraction more evenly among the network\u2019s CPRs. Our results reinforce the importance of adaptive allocation in self-regulation for populations who share linearly degrading CPRs; although uniform-allocation extraction habits can help to sustain higher resource quality than does unconstrained extraction, in general this does not improve collective benefits for a population in the long term.</jats:p>",

Seeking to elucidate this surprising fact, here we unveil distinct characteristics of stochastic-like behavior for collections of Collatz orbits by considering methods commonly employed to temporal series, as cryptography tests, power-spectrum, detrended fluctuation, auto-correlation and entropy measure. Besides confirming previous predictions that the Collatz orbits display some global properties of geometric Brownian motion, our results are likewise able to explain, at least heuristically, the reasons for so. In special, we show by means of comprehensive analysis that our findings cannot be ascribed to standard chaotic evolution. Moreover, we identify novel short- and mid-range correlations in the Collatz orbits. The Collatz map is hence a paradigmatic example of an arithmetic dynamical system which could also be regarded as displaying key characteristics of an arithmetic statistical physics system, explaining its dynamical richness.</jats:p>",

We consider that individuals of one species perform a self-preservation strategy by reducing the mobility rate to minimise infection risk whenever an epidemic outbreak reaches the neighbourhood. Running stochastic simulations, we quantify the changes in spatial patterns induced by unevenness in the cyclic game introduced by the mobility restriction strategy of organisms of one out of the species. Our findings show that variations in disease virulence impact the benefits of dispersal limitation reaction, with the relative reduction of the organisms\u2019 infection risk accentuating in surges of less contagious or deadlier diseases. The effectiveness of the mobility restriction tactic depends on the deceleration level and the fraction of infected neighbours which is considered too dangerous, thus triggering the defensive strategy. If each organism promptly reacts to the arrival of the first viral vectors in its surroundings with strict mobility reduction, contamination risk decreases significantly. Our conclusions may help biologists understand the impact of defensive strategies in ecosystems during an epidemic.</jats:p>",

The model contains a large number of species, each with a finite population of individuals, subject to discrete reproduction and death events. The interaction coefficients determining the rates of these events is chosen from an ensemble of random matrices, and is kept fixed in time. The set-up is such that the model reduces to the known generalised Lotka\u2013Volterra equations with random interaction coefficients in the limit of an infinite population for each species. Demographic noise in the individual-based model means that species which would survive in the Lotka\u2013Volterra model can become extinct. These noise-driven extinctions are the focus of the paper. We find that, for increasing complexity of interactions, ecological communities generally become less prone to extinctions induced by demographic noise. An exception are systems composed entirely of predator-prey pairs. These systems are known to be stable in deterministic Lotka\u2013Volterra models with random interactions, but, as we show, they are nevertheless particularly vulnerable to fluctuations.</jats:p>",

It is well-known that the length of a queue that awaits service or the time spent by a job in a queue depends not only on the  service rate, but also crucially on the fluctuations in service time. The larger the fluctuations, the longer the delay becomes and hence, this is a major hindrance for the queue to operate efficiently. Various strategies have been adapted to prevent this drawback. In this perspective, we investigate the effects of one such novel strategy namely resetting or restart, an emerging concept in statistical physics and stochastic complex process, that was recently introduced to mitigate fluctuations-induced delays in queues. In particular, we show that a service resetting mechanism accompanied with an overhead time can remarkably shorten the average queue lengths and waiting times. We examine various resetting strategies and further shed light on the intricate role of the overhead times to the queuing performance. Our analysis opens up future avenues in operation research where resetting-based strategies can be universally promising.</jats:p>",

We can construct a simple mean-field dynamical model with the law, which explains how the network learns.

We find that the systems driven by ongoing fluctuating inputs exhibit a bulk, a resonance, and a localized grid frequency response regime, as for static voltages. However, active voltage dynamics generically weakens the degree of localization in the grid, thereby intensifying and spatially extending the high-frequency responses. An analytic approximation scheme that takes into account shortest signal propagation paths among the voltage, phase angle and frequency variables result in an asymptotic lowest-order expansion that helps understanding the boosted high-frequency responses.

We quantitatively account for the fraction of choice reversals between two repetitions of the experiment, using a probabilistic choice formulation in the simplest form without model assumption or adjustable parameters. The prediction of choice reversal is then refined by introducing heterogeneity between decision makers through their differentiation into two groups: \u2018majoritarian\u2019 and \u2018contrarian\u2019 (in proportion 3:1). This supports the first fundamental tenet of QDT, which models choice as an inherent probabilistic process, where the probability of a prospect can be expressed as the sum of its utility and attraction factors. We propose to parameterize the utility factor with a stochastic version of cumulative prospect theory (logit-CPT), and the attraction factor with a constant absolute risk aversion function. For this dataset, and penalising the larger number of QDT parameters via the Wilks test of nested hypotheses, the QDT model is found to perform significantly better than logit-CPT at both the aggregate and individual levels, and for all considered fit criteria for the first experiment iteration and for predictions (second \u2018out-of-sample\u2019 iteration). The distinctive QDT effect captured by the attraction factor is mostly appreciable (i.e. most relevant and strongest in amplitude) for prospects with big losses. Our quantitative analysis of the experimental results supports the existence of an intrinsic limit of predictability, which is associated with the inherent probabilistic nature of choice. The results of the paper can find applications both in the prediction of choice of human decision makers as well as for organizing the operation of artificial intelligence.</jats:p>",

The availability of data for the perimeters encompassing several years suggests the opportunity of correlating the morphological variations in time with the properties of their shrinkage. In this work, we investigate the multifractal properties of the perimeters of the Lombardy glaciers in the Italian Alps. We characterize the area and perimeter distributions of the population of glaciers and we show that the distribution of perimeters exhibits a marked peak, not present in the distribution of areas. We analyze the area-perimeter relation, which is characterized by a power-law behavior that indicates a fractal structure of the perimeters with fractal dimension 1.2, independently from the size of the glaciers. We investigate the multifractal spectra of perimeters and we show that their features are strongly correlated with the area of the glaciers. Finally, we study the time evolution of the area and perimeter of glaciers and we detect the existence of a large class of glaciers whose perimeters increase while their areas decrease.

We demonstrate how heteroclinic units can act as pacemakers to entrain larger sets of units from a resting state to hierarchical heteroclinic motion that is able to describe fast oscillations modulated by slow oscillations. Such features are observed in brain dynamics. The entrainment range depends on the type of coupling, the spatial location of the pacemaker and the individual bifurcation parameters of the pacemaker and the driven units. Noise as well as a small back-coupling to the pacemaker facilitate synchronization. Units can be synchronously entrained to different temporal patterns encoding transiently excited neural populations, depending on the selected path in the heteroclinic network. Via entrainment, these temporal patterns, locally generated by the pacemakers, can be communicated to the resting units in target waves over a spatial grid. For getting entrained there is no need of fine-tuning the parameters of the resting units. Thus, entrainment provides one way of processing information over the grid, when information is encoded in the generated spatiotemporal patterns.</jats:p>",

In particular, one of these substances is N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an agonist serotonergic psychedelic that can induce profound alterations in the state of consciousness. In this work, we use an exploratory tool to reveal DMT-induced changes in brain activity using EEG data and provide new insights into the mechanisms of action of this psychedelic substance. We used a two-class classification based on (A) the connectivity matrix or (B) complex network measures derived from it as input to a support vector machine (SVM). We found that both approaches could detect changes in the brain\u2019s automatic activity, with case (B) showing the highest AUC (89%), indicating that complex network measurements best capture the brain changes that occur due to DMT use. In the second step, we ranked the features that contributed the most to this result. For case (A), we found that differences in the high alpha, low beta, and delta frequency bands were most important in distinguishing between the state before and after DMT inhalation, which is consistent with the results described in the literature. Further, the connection between the temporal (TP8) and central cortex (C3) and between the precentral gyrus (FC5) and the lateral occipital cortex (P8) contributed most to the classification result. The connection between regions TP8 and C3 has been found in the literature associated with finger movements that might have occurred during DMT consumption. However, the connection between cortical areas FC5 and P8 has not been found in the literature and is presumably related to the volunteers\u2019 emotional, visual, sensory, perceptual, and mystical experiences during DMT consumption. For case (B), closeness centrality was the most crucial complex network measure. Furthermore, we discovered larger communities and longer average path lengths when DMT was used and the converse when not, showing that the balance between functional segregation and integration had been disrupted. These findings support the idea that cortical brain activity becomes more entropic under psychedelics. Overall, a robust computational workflow has been developed here with interpretability of how DMT (or other psychedelics) modify brain networks and insights into their mechanism of action. Finally, the same methodology applied here may help interpret EEG time series from patients who consumed other psychedelic drugs.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Existing information-theoretic frameworks based on maximum entropy network ensembles are not able to explain the emergence of heterogeneity in complex networks. Here, we fill this gap of knowledge by developing a classical framework for networks based on finding an optimal trade-off between the information content of a compressed representation of the ensemble and the information content of the actual network ensemble. We introduce a novel classical network ensemble satisfying a set of soft constraints and we find the optimal distribution of the constraints for this ensemble. We show that for the classical network ensemble in which the only constraints are the expected degrees a power-law degree distribution is optimal. Also, we study spatially embedded networks finding that the interactions between nodes naturally lead to non-uniform spread of nodes in the embedding space, leading in some cases to a fractal distribution of nodes. This result is consistent with the so called `blessing of non-uniformity' of data, i.e. the fact that real world data typically do not obey uniform distributions. The pertinent features of real-world air transportation networks are well described by the proposed framework.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Complex real-world phenomena are often modeled as dynamical systems on networks. In many cases of interest, the spectrum of the underlying graph Laplacian sets the system stability and ultimately shapes the matter or information flow. This motivates devising suitable strategies, with rigorous mathematical foundation, to generate Laplacians that possess prescribed spectra. In this paper, we show that a weighted Laplacian can be constructed so as to <jats:italic>exactly</jats:italic> realize a desired <jats:italic>complex</jats:italic> spectrum. The method configures as a non trivial generalization of existing recipes which assume the spectra to be real. Applications of the proposed technique to (i) a network of Stuart\u2013Landau oscillators and (ii) to the Kuramoto model are discussed. Synchronization can be enforced by assuming a properly engineered, signed and weighted, adjacency matrix to rule the pattern of pairing interactions.</jats:p>",

Simplicial complexes are higher-order networks that allow a comprehensive investigation of the interplay between topology and dynamics. However, simplicial complexes have the limitation that they only capture undirected higher-order interactions while in real-world scenarios, often there is a need to introduce the direction of simplices, extending the popular notion of direction of edges. On graphs and networks the Magnetic Laplacian, a special case of connection Laplacian, is becoming a popular operator to address edge directionality. Here we tackle the challenge of handling directionality in simplicial complexes by formulating higher-order connection Laplacians taking into account the configurations induced by the simplices\u2019 directions. Specifically, we define all the connection Laplacians of directed simplicial complexes of dimension two and we discuss the induced higher-order diffusion dynamics by considering instructive synthetic examples of simplicial complexes. The proposed higher-order diffusion processes can be adopted in real scenarios when we want to consider higher-order diffusion displaying non-trivial frustration effects due to conflicting directionalities of the incident simplices.</jats:p>",

These structural barriers are known to take many forms at different scales\u2014hubs in otherwise sparse organizations, large dense teams, or global core-periphery structure\u2014but we lack an understanding of how these different structures interact and shape dynamics. Here we take a first theoretical step in bridging the gap between the mathematical literature on localization of spreading dynamics and the more applied literature on knowledge silos in organizational interaction networks. To do so, we introduce a new model that considers a layered structure of teams to unveil a new form of hierarchical localization (i.e. the localization of information at the top or center of an organization) and study its interplay with known phenomena of mesoscopic localization (i.e. the localization of information in large groups), <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-core localization (i.e. around denser subgraphs) and hub localization (i.e. around high degree stars). We also include a complex contagion mechanism by considering a general infection kernel which can depend on hierarchical level (influence), degree (popularity), infectious neighbors (social reinforcement) or team size (importance). This very general model allows us to explore the multifaceted phenomenon of information siloing in complex organizational interaction networks and opens the door to new optimization problems to promote or hinder the emergence of different localization regimes.</jats:p>",

We investigate a random graph model that incorporates local clique structures, and thus deviates from the locally tree-like behavior of most standard random graph models. For the process of bond percolation, we derive analytical approximations for large percolation probabilities and the critical percolation value. Interestingly, these derivations show that when the average degree of a vertex is large, the influence of the deviations from the locally tree-like structure is small. In our simulations, this insensitivity to local clique structures often already kicks in for networks with average degrees as low as 6. Furthermore, we show that the different behavior of bond percolation on clustered networks compared to tree-like networks that was found in previous works can be almost completely attributed to differences in degree sequences rather than differences in clustering structures. We finally show that these results also extend to completely different types of dynamics, by deriving similar conclusions and simulations for the Kuramoto model on the same types of clustered and non-clustered networks.</jats:p>",

Using the realistic nuclear shell model and the quadrupole moment as an observable we demonstrate that the relaxation time is significantly longer than defined by the survival probability of the initial state.

In this work, we briefly review a novel framework grounded on statistical physics and techniques inspired by quantum statistical mechanics which have been successfully used for the analysis of a variety of complex systems. The advantage of this framework is that it allows one to define a set of information-theoretic tools which find widely used counterparts in machine learning and quantum information science, while providing a grounded physical interpretation in terms of a statistical field theory of information dynamics.

A selective way of birds that reacts to their neighbors is one of the main factors characterizing the collective behaviors. Individual birds can react differently depending on their local environment during the collective decision-making process, and these variable reactions can be a source of complex spatiotemporal flocking dynamics. Here, we extend the deterministic Cucker\u2013Smale model by including the individual\u2019s reaction to neighbors\u2019 acceleration where the reaction time depends on the local state of polarity. Simulation results show that the adaptive reaction of individuals induces the collective response of the flock. Birds are not frozen in a complete synchronization but remain sensitive to perturbations coming from environments. We confirm that the adaptivity of the reaction also generates natural fluctuations of orientation and speed, both of which are indeed scale-free as experimentally reported. This work may provide essential insight in designing resilient systems of many active agents working in complex, unpredictable environments.</jats:p>",

One type of dynamics that has attracted increasing attention because of its several potential implications is opinion formation. A phenomenon of particular importance, known to take place in opinion formation, is echo chambers\u2019 appearance. In the present work, we approach this phenomenon, while emphasizing the influence of contrarian opinions in a multi-opinion scenario. To define the contrarian opinion, we considered the<jats:italic>underdog</jats:italic>effect, which is the eventual tendency of people to support the less popular option. We also considered an adaptation of the Sznajd dynamics with the possibility of friendship rewiring, performed on several network models. We analyze the relationship between topology and opinion dynamics by considering two measurements: opinion diversity and network modularity. Two specific situations have been addressed: (i) the agents can reconnect only with others sharing the same opinion; and (ii) same as in the previous case, but with the agents reconnecting only within a limited neighborhood. This choice can be justified because, in general, friendship is a transitive property along with subsequent neighborhoods (e.g., two friends of a person tend to know each other). As the main results, we found that the underdog effect, if strong enough, can balance the agents\u2019 opinions. On the other hand, this effect decreases the possibilities of echo chamber formation. We also found that the restricted reconnection case reduced the chances of echo chamber formation and led to smaller echo chambers.</jats:p>",

The foundations of these relationships are rooted in the decision making of individuals, and whether they choose to be selfish or altruistic. How individuals choose their behaviors can be analyzed using a strategy optimization process in the framework of game theory. Previous studies have shown that reference to individuals\u2019 previous actions plays an important role in their choice of strategies and establishment of social relationships. A fundamental question remains as to whether an individual with more information can exploit another who has less information when learning the choice of strategies. Here we demonstrate that a player using a memory-one strategy, who can refer to their own previous action and that of their opponent, can be exploited by a reactive player, who only has the information of the other player, based on mutual adaptive learning. This is counterintuitive because the former has more choice in strategies and can potentially obtain a higher payoff. We demonstrated this by formulating the learning process of strategy choices to optimize the payoffs in terms of coupled replicator dynamics and applying it to the prisoner\u2019s dilemma game. Further, we show that the player using a memory-one strategy, by referring to their previous experience, can sometimes act more generous toward the opponent\u2019s defection, thereby accepting the opponent\u2019s exploitation. Mainly, we found that through adaptive learning, a player with limited information usually exploits the player with more information, leading to asymmetric exploitation.</jats:p>",

The first concerns the difficulties neural networks may experience in capturing rare events due to limitations in how data is sampled. The second arises from the inherent multiscale nature of these systems. They combine high-frequency components (like inertia-gravity waves) with slower, evolving processes (geostrophic motion). This multiscale nature creates a significant hurdle for neural network closures. To illustrate these challenges, we focus on the atmospheric 1980 Lorenz model, a simplified version of the Primitive Equations that drive climate models.

Further, our approach does not require an initial system identification step, resulting in a relatively simple and efficient learning process. Reservoir computers are well-suited to the control problem because they require small training data sets and remarkably low training times. By iteratively training and adding layers of reservoir computers to the controller, a precise and efficient control law is identified quickly. With examples on both numerical and high-speed experimental systems, we demonstrate that our approach is capable of controlling highly complex dynamical systems that display deterministic chaos to nontrivial target trajectories.</jats:p>",

Notable examples are the frequency and amplitude chimeras, chimera death states, solitary states as well as combinations of these. In a previous study [Journal of Physics: Complexity, 2020, 1(2), 025006], a toy model was introduced addressing possible mechanisms behind the formation of frequency chimera states. In the present study a variation of the toy model is proposed to address the formation of amplitude chimeras. The proposed oscillatory model is now equipped with an additional 3rd order equation modulating the amplitude of the network oscillators. This way, the single oscillators are constructed as bistable in amplitude and depending on the initial conditions their amplitude may result in one of the two stable \ufb01xed points. Numerical simulations demonstrate that when these oscillators are nonlocally coupled in networks, they organize in domains with alternating amplitudes (related to the two \ufb01xed points), naturally forming amplitude chimeras. A second extension of this model incorporates nonlinear terms merging amplitude together with frequency, and this extension allows for the spontaneous production of composite amplitude-and-frequency chimeras occurring simultaneously in the network. Moreover the extended model allows to understand the emergence of bump states via the continuous passage from chimera states, when both \ufb01xed point amplitudes are positive, to bump states when one of the two \ufb01xed points vanishes. The synchronization properties of the network are studied as a function of the system parameters for the case of amplitude chimeras, bump states and composite amplitude-and-frequency chimeras. The proposed mechanisms of creating domains with variable amplitudes and/or frequencies provide a generic scenario for understanding the formation of the complex synchronization phenomena observed in networks of coupled nonlinear and chaotic oscillators.&amp;#xD;</jats:p>",

We use evolutionary game theory to model scenarios where the government wishes to incentivise auditing, but cannot discriminate between high and low-quality auditing. We warn that it is alarmingly easy to stumble on 'Adversarial incentives', which prevent a sustainable market for auditing AI systems from forming. Adversarial Incentives mainly reward auditors for catching unsafe behaviour. If AI companies learn to tailor their behaviour to the quality of audits, the lack of opportunities to catch unsafe behaviour will discourage auditors from innovating. Instead, we recommend that governments always reward auditors, except when they find evidence that those auditors failed to detect unsafe behaviour they should have. These 'Vigilant Incentives' could encourage auditors to find innovative ways to evaluate cutting-edge AI systems.&amp;#xD;Overall, our analysis provides useful insights for the design and implementation of efficient incentive strategies for encouraging a robust auditing ecosystem.</jats:p>",

This claim is taken up in the present work by investigating the predictability of a coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere extratropical model under a one-way forcing generated by a tropical model. Both models display a chaotic dynamics, and the dominant variable of the extratropical model displays a high correlation with the tropical forcing in the reference simulation, inducing a low-frequency variability signal in the extratropics. Numerical experiments emulating the presence of initial condition errors in the tropical model are conducted to clarify their impact on the predictability in the extratropics. It is shown that: (i) the correlation skill of the dominant observable affected by the forcing is considerably degraded at interannual time scales due to the presence of initial condition errors in the tropics, limiting the potential of teleconnections; (ii) averaging of an ensemble of forecasts\u2013with a small number of members\u2013may substantially improve the quality of the forecasts; and (iii) temporal averaging may also improve the quality of the forecasts (at the expense of being able to forecast extreme events), in particular when the forcing affects weakly the observable under interest.</jats:p>",

We investigate the spatial rock-paper-scissors models with a regional unevenness that reduces the selection capacity of organisms of one species. Our results show that the regionally weak species predominates in the local ecosystem, while spiral patterns appear far from the region, where individuals of every species play the rock-paper-scissors game with the same strength. Because the weak species controls all local territory, it is attractive for the other species to enter the local ecosystem to conquer the territory. However, our stochastic simulations show that the transitory waves formed when organisms of the strong species reach the region are quickly destroyed because of local strength unbalance in the selection game rules. Computing the effect of the topology on population dynamics, we find that the prevalence of the weak species becomes more significant if the transition of the selection capacity to the area of uneven rock-paper-scissors rules is smooth. Finally, our findings show that the biodiversity loss due to the arising of regional unevenness is minimised if the transition to the region where the cyclic game is unbalanced is abrupt. Our results may be helpful to biologists in comprehending the consequences of changes in the environmental conditions on species coexistence and spatial patterns in complex systems.</jats:p>",

Depending on the capacity limit, interventions may (i) leave the standard second order phase transition unchanged but exponentially suppress the probability of large outbreaks, (ii) induce a first-order discontinuous transition to macroscopic outbreaks, or (iii) cause a secondary explosive yet continuous third-order transition. These insights highlight inherent limitations in predicting and containing epidemic outbreaks. More generally our study offers a cornerstone example of a third-order explosive phase transition in complex systems.</jats:p>",

The overall operational state of these systems therefore crucially depends on the correct and reliable functioning of the individual elements as well as the information they transmit through the network. Here, we investigate the effect of Byzantine attacks where one unit does not behave as expected, but is controlled by an external attacker. For such attacks, we assess the impact on the global collective behavior of nonlinearly coupled phase oscillators.

Based on local basin landscapes which correspond to single-node perturbations, we demonstrate that the uncertainty shows strong spatial variability. While perturbations at many nodes only allow for a few outcomes, other local landscapes show extreme complexity with more than a hundred basins. Particularly complex domains in the latter can be related to unstable invariant chaotic sets of saddle type. Most importantly, we show that the characteristic dynamics on these chaotic saddles can be associated with certain topological structures of the network. We find that one particular tree-like substructure allows for the chaotic response to perturbations at nodes in the north of Great Britain.

To test our model, we make use of empirical association data of a group of free-ranging spider monkeys in Yucatan, Mexico. Our homophilic WSN model reproduces many of the properties of the empirical association network with statistical significance, specifically, the average weight of sex-dependent interactions (female-female, female-male, male-male), the weight distribution function, as well as many weighted macro properties (node strength, weighted clustering, and weighted number of modules), even for different age group combinations (adults, subadults, and juveniles). Furthermore, by performing simulations with fitted parameters, we show that one of the main features of a spider monkey social system, namely, stronger male-male interactions over female-female or female-male ones, can be accounted for by an asymmetry in the node-type composition of a bipartisan network, independently of group size. The reinforcement of connections among members of minority groups could be a general structuring mechanism in homophilic social networks.</jats:p>",

A common strategy to investigate it is to find community structure of these networks. However, methods of finding these communities are often sensitive to noise in the gene expression data and the inherent stochasticity of the community detection algorithms. Here we introduce an approach for identifying functional groups and their hierarchical organization in gene co-expression networks from expression data. A network describing the relatedness in the expression profiles of genes is first inferred using an information theoretic approach. Community structure within the inferred network is found by using <jats:italic>modularity maximization</jats:italic>. This community structure is further refined using three-body structural correlations to robustly identify important functional gene communities. We apply this approach to the expression data of <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> genes and identify 25 robust groups, many of which show key associations with important biological functions as demonstrated by gene ontology term enrichment analysis. Thus, our approach makes specific and novel predictions about the function of these genes.</jats:p>",

More specifically, two data elements are linked whenever the similarity between their respective features, gauged by some similarity index, is greater than a given threshold. Weighted networks can also be obtained by taking these indices as weights.

In addition, a parameter <jats:italic>\u03b1</jats:italic> is introduced that can be used to control the contribution of positive and negative joint variations between the considered features, catering for enhanced flexibility while obtaining networks.

Simple models of neural activity based on real anatomical networks have proven to be effective in describing features of whole-brain spontaneous activity when tuned at their critical point. In this work, we show that structural networks are indeed a crucial ingredient in the emergence of collective oscillations in a whole-brain stochastic model at criticality. We study analytically a stochastic Greenberg\u2013Hastings cellular automaton in the mean-field limit, showing that it undergoes an abrupt phase transition with a bistable region. In particular, no global oscillations emerge in this limit. Then, we show that by introducing a network structure in the homeostatic normalization regime, the bistability may be disrupted, and the transition may become smooth. Concomitantly, through an interplay between network topology and weights, a large peak in the power spectrum appears around the transition point, signaling the emergence of collective oscillations. Hence, both the structure of brain networks and criticality are fundamental in driving the collective responses of whole-brain stochastic models.</jats:p>",

This property of complex systems can be identified in virtually all natural systems surrounding us, but also in many social, economic, and technological systems. The defining characteristics of complex systems imply that their dynamics can often only be captured from the analysis of simulated or observed data. Here, we summarize recent advances in nonlinear data analysis of both simulated and real-world complex systems, with a focus on recurrence analysis for the investigation of individual or small sets of time series, and complex networks for the analysis of possibly very large, spatiotemporal datasets. We review and explain the recent success of these two key concepts of complexity science with an emphasis on applications for the analysis of geoscientific and in particular (palaeo-) climate data. In particular, we present several prominent examples where challenging problems in Earth system and climate science have been successfully addressed using recurrence analysis and complex networks. We outline several open questions for future lines of research in the direction of data-based complex system analysis, again with a focus on applications in the Earth sciences, and suggest possible combinations with suitable machine learning approaches. Beyond Earth system analysis, these methods have proven valuable also in many other scientific disciplines, such as neuroscience, physiology, epidemics, or engineering.</jats:p>",

Consider a one dimensional bistable stochastic system, characterized by a deterministic double well potential and shaken by an additive noise source. When subject to an external periodic drive, and for a proper choice of the noise strength, the system swings regularly between the two existing deterministic fixed points, with just one switch for each oscillation of the imposed forcing term. This resonant condition can be exploited to unravel weak periodic signals, otherwise inaccessible to conventional detectors. Here, we will set to revisit the stochastic resonance concept by operating in a modified framework where bistability is induced by the nonlinear nature of the multiplicative noise. A candidate model is in particular introduced which fulfils the above requirements while allowing for analytical progress to be made.  Working with reference to this case study, we elaborate on the conditions for the onset of the generalized stochastic resonance mechanism. As a byproduct of the analysis, a novel resonant regime is also identified which displays no lower bound for the frequencies that can be resolved, at variance with the traditional setting.</jats:p>",

To measure DEDP of economy from different perspective, two types of metrics are constructed. One is the determination coefficient of regression analysis, which exhibits significant positive correlations with population size of economy, uncovering differences of development paths among economies of varying population sizes. The other type of metrics is based on the consistency on regression coefficients and effectively explains disparities among economies in the growth rate on GDP per capita, economic complexity index and economic fitness. These findings reveal the differences in development paths among different countries from the perspective of referentiality for development patterns, suggesting the potential existence of the paths with more universal meaning to economic development.</jats:p>",

We study a non-ordinary state of mind by comparing resting-state functional brain networks of individuals in two different conditions: before and after the ingestion of the psychedelic brew Ayahuasca. In order to quantify the functional, statistical symmetries between brain region connectivity, we calculate the pairwise information parity of the functional brain networks. Unlike the usual approach to quantitative network analysis that considers only local or global scales, information parity instead quantifies pairwise statistical similarities over the entire network structure. We find an increase in the average information parity on brain networks of individuals under psychedelic influences. Notably, the information parity between regions from the limbic system and frontal cortex is consistently higher for all the individuals while under the psychedelic influence. These findings suggest that the resemblance of statistical influences between pair of brain regions activities tends to increase under Ayahuasca effects.

Within this framework, we investigate the transition-path properties of an underdamped particle surmounting an energy barrier, and we show explicitly how these properties are affected by the activity and persistence of the particle. Our theoretical study suggests that an active particle can cross the barrier at comparatively shorter timescales by lowering the (effective) barrier height. In particular, we study how the persistence time of the active force alters the transition-path time (TPT) at different friction limits. Interestingly, in one of our models we find a nonmonotonic behaviour of the TPT which is absent in the overdamped limit.

This drift induces a regime shift when the parameter crosses a bifurcation. Here, we study the case of an infinite dimensional system: a time-delayed oscillator whose time delay varies at a small but non-negligible rate. Our research shows that due to this parameter drift, trajectories from a chaotic attractor tip to other states with a certain probability. This causes the appearance of the phenomenon of transient chaos. By using an ensemble approach, we find a gamma distribution of transient lifetimes, unlike in other non-delayed systems where normal distributions have been found to govern the process. Furthermore, we analyze how the parameter change rate influences the tipping probability, and we derive a scaling law relating the parameter value for which the tipping takes place and the lifetime of the transient chaos with the parameter change rate.</jats:p>",

A microscopic theory is needed to connect the spreading dynamics with individual behaviors. In this letter, we unify the description of different spreading dynamics by decomposing the microscopic dynamics into two basic processes, the aging process and the contact process. A hierarchical duration coarse-grained (DCG) approach is proposed to study the duration-dependent processes. Applied to the epidemic spreading, such formalism is feasible to reproduce different epidemic models, e.g., the SIS and the SIR models, and to associate the macroscopic spreading parameters with the microscopic mechanism. The DCG approach enables us to study the steady state of the duration-dependent SIS model. The current hierarchical formalism can also be used to describe the spreading of information and public opinions, or to model a reliability theory on networks.</jats:p>",

It is thus important to see how these networks do learn and implement such representations. The first step in this direction is to characterize the function and learning capabilities of basic artificial reaction networks. In this study, we consider multilayer networks of reversible reactions that connect two layers of signal and response species through an intermediate layer of hidden species. We introduce a stochastic learning algorithm that updates the reaction rates based on the correlation values between reaction products and responses. Our findings indicate that the function of networks with random reaction rates, as well as their learning capacity for random signal-response activities, are critically determined by the number of reactants and reaction products. Moreover, the stored patterns exhibit different levels of robustness and qualities as the reaction rates deviate from their optimal values in a stochastic model of defect evolution. These findings can help suggest network modules that are better suited to specific functions, such as amplifiers or dampeners, or to the learning of biologically relevant signal-response activities.</jats:p>",

Operating at a critical threshold requires precise parameter tuning and a corresponding mechanism remains an open question. Recent studies have suggested that topological features observed in brain networks give rise to a Griffiths phase, leading to power-law scaling in brain activity dynamics and the operational benefits of criticality in an extended parameter region. Motivated by growing evidence of neural correlates of different states of consciousness, we investigate how topological changes affect the expression of a Griffiths phase. We analyze the activity decay in modular networks using a susceptible-infected-susceptible propagation model and find that we can control the extension of the Griffiths phase by altering intra- and intermodular connectivity. We find that by adjusting system parameters, we can counteract changes in critical behavior and maintain a stable critical region despite changes in network topology. Our results give insight into how structural network properties affect the emergence of a Griffiths phase and how its features are linked to established topological network metrics. We discuss how those findings could contribute to an understanding of the changes in functional brain networks.</jats:p>",

Second, we highlight that the predictive power of various economic complexity measures for income is crucially sensitive to other factors that shift marginal cost from its efficient level in manufacturing sectors. The essence of such an issue lies in the assumption that the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) correctly reflects a country\u2019s real capability of specialization across different goods. However, there would exist a gap between the core idea of learning the national complexity from RCA and the fact that the revealed specialization pattern in data may not necessarily suggest a country\u2019s actual capability in the presence of distortions, the latter of which is ubiquitous across developing countries.</jats:p>",

Since decades, as a leading climate scientist he is aware of the need for creative cooperation between climate scientists and researchers from other fields, especially economics. To facilitate such cooperation, he has designed a productive research program for economic analysis in view of climate change. Without blurring the differences between economics and physics, the Hasselmann program stresses the complexities of today\u2019s economy. This includes the importance of heterogeneous actors and different time scales, of making major uncertainties explicit and bringing researchers and practitioners in close interaction. The program has triggered decades of collaborative research, especially in the network of the Global Climate Forum, that he has founded for this purpose. Research inspired by Hasselmann\u2019s innovative ideas has led to a farewell to outdated economic approaches: single-equilibrium models, a single constant discount rate, framing the climate challenge as a kind of prisoner\u2019s dilemma and framing it as a problem of scarcity requiring sacrifices from the majority of today\u2019s population. Instead of presenting the climate problem as the ultimate apocalyptic narrative, he sees it as a challenge to be mastered. To meet this challenge requires careful research in order to identify underutilisation of human, technical and social capacities that offer the keys to a climate friendly world economy. Climate neutrality may then be achieved by activating these capacities through investment-oriented climate strategies, designed and implemented by different actors both in industrialised and developing countries. The difficulties to bring global greenhouse gas emissions down to net zero are enormous; the Hasselmann program holds promise of significant advances in this endeavour.</jats:p>",

Second, by analyzing the model parameters, we found that the typical growth pattern is not only a logistic function, which often appears in various complex systems, but also a non-trivial growth curve that starts with an exponential function and asymptotically approaches a power function without a steady state. We also observed a connection between the functional form of growth and the peak-out behavior.

Here we show that a clear view of such dynamics is provided by identifying KAM tori or chaotic regions of the dissipation-free case, and following their time evolution in the dissipative dynamics. The tori often smoothly deform first, but later they become disintegrated and dissolve in a kind of shrinking chaos.

Agents play in their group by using two simple sets of rules, called \u2018blind\u2019 and \u2018rational\u2019 model, respectively, that are inspired by the observed behavior of human participants in laboratory experiments. In addition, unsatisfied agents have the option of leaving their group and migrating to a new random one through probabilistic choices. Stochasticity, and the introduction of two types of players in the blind model, help simulate the heterogeneous behavior that is often observed in experimental work. Our numerical simulations of the corresponding dynamical systems show that being able to leave a group when unsatisfied favors contribution and avoids free-riding to a good extent in a range of the enhancement factor where defection would prevail without migration. Our numerical simulation presents results that are qualitatively in line with known experimental data when human agents are given the same kind of information about themselves and the other players in the group. This is usually not the case with customary mathematical models based on replicator dynamics or stochastic approaches.

With reference to a simple dyadic system composed of two coupled units, the successful application of net transfer entropy-based inference relies on unidirectional coupling between the units and their homogeneous dynamics. What happens when the units are bidirectionally coupled and have different dynamics? Through analytical and numerical insights, we show that net transfer entropy may lead to erroneous inference of the dominant direction of influence that stems from its dependence on the units\u2019 individual dynamics. To control for these confounding effects, one should incorporate further knowledge about the units\u2019 time-histories through the recent framework offered by momentary information transfer. In this realm, we demonstrate the use of two measures: controlled and fully controlled transfer entropies, which consistently yield the correct direction of dominant coupling irrespective of the sources and targets individual dynamics. Through the study of two real-world examples, we identify critical limitations with respect to the use of net transfer entropy in the inference of causal mechanisms that warrant prudence by the community.</jats:p>",

We carry out a systematic investigation of the structural complexity of the nebula using publicly available imaging data at radio frequency. For the analysis, we use the well-known multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis in two dimensions. We find that radio data exhibit long-range correlations, as expected from the underlying physics of the supernova explosion and evolution. The correlations follow a power-law scaling with length scales. The structural complexity is found to be multifractal in nature, as evidenced by the dependence of the generalized Hurst exponent on the order of the moments of the detrended fluctuation function. By repeating the analysis on shuffled data, we further probe the origin of the multifractality in the radio imaging data. For the radio data, we find that the probability density function is close to a Gaussian form. Hence, the multifractal behavior is due to the differing nature of long-range correlations of the large and small detrended fluctuation field values. We investigate the multifractal parameters across different partitions of the radio image and find that the structures across the image are highly heterogeneous, making the Crab Nebula a structurally complex astrophysical system. Our analysis thus provides a fresh perspective on the morphology of the Crab Nebula from a complexity science viewpoint.</jats:p>",

The present work describes a methodology for quantifying the degree of adherence between a given hierarchical template and a respective modular document (e.g. books or homepages with content organized into modules) organized as a respective content network. The original document, which in the case of the present work concerns Wikipedia pages, is transformed into a respective content network by first dividing the document into parts or modules. Then, the contents (words) of each pair of modules are compared in terms of the coincidence similarity index, yielding a respective weight. The adherence between the hierarchical template and the content network can then be measured by considering the coincidence similarity between the respective adjacency matrices, leading to the respective hierarchical adherence index. In order to provide additional information about this adherence, four specific indices are also proposed, quantifying the number of links between non-adjacent levels, links between nodes in the same level, converging links between adjacent levels, and missing links. The potential of the approach is illustrated respectively to model-theoretical networks as well as to real-world data obtained from Wikipedia. In addition to confirming the effectiveness of the suggested concepts and methods, the results suggest that real-world documents do not tend to substantially adhere to respective hierarchical templates.</jats:p>",

We focused on small complex networks with node degrees ranging from zero to a maximum of approximately 20 to study agent behavior in traffic and transportation networks. We measured the hunting rate, that is, the rate of change of agent amounts in each node per unit of time, and the imbalance of agent distribution among nodes. Our simulation study reveals that the topological structure of a network precisely determines agent distribution when agents perform full random walks; however, their destination selections alter the agent distribution. Notably, rule (c) makes hunting and imbalance rates significantly high compared with random walk cases (a) and (b), irrespective of network types, when the network has a high degree and high activity rate. Compared with the full random walk in (a) and (b) increases the hunting rate while decreasing the imbalance rate when activity is low; however, both increase when activity is high. These characteristics exhibit slight periodic undulations over time. Furthermore, our analysis shows that in the BA, ER, and WS network models, the hunting rate decreases and the imbalance rate increases when the system disconnects randomly selected nodes in simulations where agents follow rules (a)\u2013(c) and the network has the ability to disconnect nodes within a certain time of all time steps.

Our methodology is general enough to be used in any situation when the contribution of specific groups to overall network modularity and polarization is needed to investigate. Moreover, using the concept of partial domination, we are able to compare the reach of sets of influential profiles from different groups and their ability to accomplish coordinated communication inside their groups and across segments of the entire network.

In this work we derive the mean-field equations for the equilibrium behavior of vector spin models on high-connectivity random networks with an arbitrary degree distribution and with randomly weighted links. We demonstrate that the high-connectivity limit of spin models on networks is not universal in that it depends on the full degree distribution. Such nonuniversal behavior is akin to a remarkable mechanism that leads to the breakdown of the central limit theorem when applied to the distribution of effective local fields. Traditional mean-field theories on fully-connected models, such as the Curie\u2013Weiss, the Kuramoto, and the Sherrington\u2013Kirkpatrick model, are only valid if the network degree distribution is highly concentrated around its mean degree. We obtain a series of results that highlight the importance of degree fluctuations to the phase diagram of mean-field spin models by focusing on the Kuramoto model of synchronization and on the Sherrington\u2013Kirkpatrick model of spin-glasses. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical findings and provide compelling evidence that the present mean-field theory describes an intermediate regime of connectivity, in which the average degree <jats:italic>c</jats:italic> scales as a power <jats:italic>c</jats:italic> \u221d <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sup>\n                     <jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\n                  </jats:sup> (<jats:italic>b</jats:italic> &lt; 1) of the total number <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> \u226b 1 of spins.

TPTs are characterized by the emergence of nontrivial homology groups as a function of a threshold parameter. Under certain conditions, one can identify TPTs via the zeros of the Euler characteristic or by singularities of the Euler entropy. Recent works provide strong evidence that TPTs can be interpreted as the intrinsic fingerprint of a complex network. This work illustrates this possibility by investigating various networks from a topological perspective. We first review the concept of TPTs in brain networks and discuss it in the context of high-order interactions in complex systems. We then investigate TPTs in protein\u2013protein interaction networks using methods of topological data analysis for two variants of the duplication\u2013divergence model. We compare our theoretical and computational results to experimental data freely available for gene co-expression networks of<jats:italic>S. cerevisiae</jats:italic>, also known as baker\u2019s yeast, as well as of the nematode<jats:italic>C. elegans</jats:italic>.

For example, due to social stigma and comorbidities, mental health support groups often form in amorphous online groups. Predicting suicidality among individuals in these settings using standard network analyses is prohibitive due to resource limits (e.g., memory), and adding auxiliary data like text to such models exacerbates complexity- and sparsity-related issues. Here, I show how merging graph and language embedding models (<jats:monospace>metapath2vec</jats:monospace> and <jats:monospace>doc2vec</jats:monospace>) avoids these limits and extracts unsupervised clustering data without domain expertise or feature engineering. Graph and language distances to a suicide support group have little correlation (<jats:italic>\u03c1</jats:italic> &lt; 0.23), implying the two models are not embedding redundant information. When used separately to predict suicidality among individuals, graph and language data generate relatively accurate results (69% and 76%, respectively) but have moderately large false-positive (25% and 21%, respectively) and false-negative (38% and 27%, respectively) rates; however, when integrated, both data produce highly accurate predictions (90%, with 10% false-positives and 12% false-negatives). Visualizing graph embeddings annotated with predictions of potentially suicidal individuals shows the integrated model could classify such individuals even if they are positioned far from the support group. These results extend research on the importance of simultaneously analyzing behavior and language in massive networks and efforts to integrate embedding models for different kinds of data when predicting and classifying, particularly when they involve rare events.</jats:p>",

This spatial coexistence has been observed in various network topologies of coupled systems, such as coupled pendula, coupled chemical oscillators, and neuronal networks. In this work, we build two-dimensional neuronal networks with regular and fractal topologies to study chimera states. In the regular network, we consider a coupling between the nearest neighbours neurons, while the fractal network is constructed according to the square Cantor set. Our networks are composed of coupled adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons, that can exhibit spike or burst activities. Depending on the parameters, we find spiral wave chimeras in both regular and fractal networks. The spiral wave chimeras arise for different values of the intensity of the excitatory synaptic conductance. In our simulations, we verify the existence of multicore chimera states. The cores are made up of neurons with desynchronous behaviour and the spiral waves rotates around them. The cores can be related to bumps or spatially localised pulses of neuronal activities. We also show that the initial value of the adaptation current plays an important role in the existence of spiral wave chimera states.</jats:p>",

Gaining a deeper understanding of the investment behaviours of VC firms is crucial for the development of a more sustainable and healthier market and economy. Contrasting evidence supports that either specialisation or diversification helps to achieve a better investment performance. However, the impact of the syndication network is overlooked. Syndication network has a great influence on the propagation of information and trust. By exploiting an authoritative VC dataset of thirty-five-year investment information in China, we construct a joint-investment network of VC firms and analyse the effects of syndication and diversification on specialisation and investment performance. There is a clear correlation between the syndication network degree and specialisation level of VC firms, which implies that the well-connected VC firms are diversified. More connections generally bring about more information or other resources, and VC firms are more likely to enter a new stage or industry with some new co-investing VC firms when compared to a randomised null model.&amp;#xD;Moreover, autocorrelation analysis of both specialisation and success rate on the syndication network indicates that clustering of similar VC firms is roughly limited to the secondary neighbourhood. When analysing local clustering patterns, we discover that, contrary to popular beliefs, there is no apparent successful club of investors. In contrast, investors with low success rates are more likely to cluster. Our discoveries enrich the understanding of VC investment behaviours and can assist policymakers in designing better strategies to promote the development of the VC industry.</jats:p>",

Namely, we suppose that infected vertices may self-quarantine and trace their infector with a given success probability. A traced infector is, in turn, less likely to infect others. We show that the effectiveness of such tracing process strongly depends on the network structure. In contrast to previous findings, the tracing procedure is not necessarily more effective on networks with heterogeneous degrees. We also show that network clustering influences the effectiveness of the tracing process in a non-trivial way: depending on the infectiousness parameter, contact tracing on clustered networks may either be more, or less efficient than on networks without clustering.</jats:p>",

The toy-oscillators are constructed as bistable units and depending on the initial conditions their frequency may result in one of the two attracting fixed points, <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"jpcomplexab79bdieqn001.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\" />\n                  </jats:inline-formula> and <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"jpcomplexab79bdieqn002.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\" />\n                  </jats:inline-formula> (two-level synchronization). Numerical simulations demonstrate that when these oscillators are nonlocally coupled in networks, they organize in domains with alternating frequencies. In each domain the oscillators synchronize, while sequential domains follow different modes of synchronization. The border elements between two consecutive domains form the asynchronous domains as they are influenced by both frequencies. This way chimera states are formed via a two-level synchronization scenario. We investigate the influence of the frequency coupling constant and of the coupling range on the chimera morphology and we show that the chimera multiplicity decreases as the coupling range increases.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The frequency spectrum is calculated in the coherent and incoherent domains of this model. In the coherent domains single frequencies (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"jpcomplexab79bdieqn003.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\" />\n                  </jats:inline-formula> or <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"jpcomplexab79bdieqn004.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\" />\n                  </jats:inline-formula>) are observed, while in the incoherent domains both <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"jpcomplexab79bdieqn005.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\" />\n                  </jats:inline-formula> and <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"jpcomplexab79bdieqn006.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\" />\n                  </jats:inline-formula> as well as their superpositions appear. This mechanism of creating domains of alternating frequencies offers a reasonable generic scenario for chimera state formation.</jats:p>",
