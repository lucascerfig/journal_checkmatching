We prove that in all these theories the purification principle is violated, meaning that some mixed states are not the reduction of a pure state in a larger system. This allows us to derive the measurement postulates of quantum theory from the structure of pure states and reversible dynamics, and the requirement that the purification principle holds. The violation of the purification principle implies that there is some irreducible classicality in these theories, which appears like an important clue for the problem of deriving the Born rule within the many-worlds interpretation. We also prove that in all such modifications the task of state tomography with local measurements is impossible, and present a simple toy theory displaying all these exotic non-quantum phenomena. This toy model shows that, contrarily to previous claims, it is possible to modify the Born rule without violating the no-signalling principle. Finally, we argue that the quantum measurement postulates are the most non-classical amongst all alternatives.</jats:p>",

This time-reversal property states that the maximum value obtained by such a function over all valid quantum strategies is also obtained when the direction of time for the function is reversed, despite the fact that the strategies themselves are generally not time reversible.

Then, local symmetries of the designed quantum state are equal to the unitary group of local mode operations acting diagonally on all traps. Therefore, such a group of symmetries is naturally protected against errors that occur in a physical realisation of mode operators.

This ensures that substantially fewer ancilla qubits are required for this procedure than prior results. Owing to the generality of the block-encoding framework, our algorithms are applicable to a variety of input models and can also be seen as improved and generalized versions of prior results on standard (non-regularized) quantum least squares algorithms.</jats:p>",

One possible choice is the map based on Fisher information introduced by Huangjun Zhu, known to be an order morphism taking values in the cone of positive semidefinite matrices.

PoWs enable the linking of blocks in the blockchain data structure and thus the problem of interest is the feasibility of obtaining a sequence (chain) of such proofs. In this work, we examine the hardness of finding such chain of PoWs against quantum strategies.

        "abstract": "<jats:p>The color code is both an interesting example of an exactly solved topologically ordered phase of matter and also among the most promising candidate models to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation with minimal resource overhead. The contributions of this work are threefold. First of all, we build upon the abstract theory of boundaries and domain walls of topological phases of matter to comprehensively catalog the objects realizable in color codes. Together with our classification we also provide lattice representations of these objects which include three new types of boundaries as well as a generating set for all 72 color code twist defects. Our work thus provides an explicit toy model that will help to better understand the abstract theory of domain walls. Secondly, we discover a number of interesting new applications of the cataloged objects for quantum information protocols. These include improved methods for performing quantum computations by code deformation, a new four-qubit error-detecting code, as well as families of new quantum error-correcting codes we call stellated color codes, which encode logical qubits at the same distance as the next best color code, but using approximately half the number of physical qubits. To the best of our knowledge, our new topological codes have the highest encoding rate of local stabilizer codes with bounded-weight stabilizers in two dimensions. Finally, we show how the boundaries and twist defects of the color code are represented by multiple copies of other phases. Indeed, in addition to the well studied comparison between the color code and two copies of the surface code, we also compare the color code to two copies of the three-fermion model. In particular, we find that this analogy offers a very clear lens through which we can view the symmetries of the color code which gives rise to its multitude of domain walls.</jats:p>",

For all other types of noise the asymptotic quantum enhancement is unavoidably limited to a constant-factor improvement over the standard quantum limit (~1/N) even when allowing for the full power of fast control. The latter holds both in the single-shot and infinitely-many repetitions scenarios. However, even in this case allowing for fast quantum control helps to increase the improvement factor. Furthermore, for frequency estimation with finite resource we show how a parallel scheme utilizing any fixed number of entangled qubits but no fast quantum control can be outperformed by a simple, easily implementable, sequential scheme which only requires entanglement between one sensing and one auxiliary qubit.</jats:p>",

Ideally, the optimal quantum estimator is given by the so-called quantum Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound, so any measurement strategy aims to obtain estimations as close as possible to it. However, more often than not, the current state-of-the-art methods to estimate quantum phases fail to reach this bound as they rely on maximum likelihood estimators of non-identifiable likelihood functions. In this work we thoroughly review various schemes for estimating the phase of a qubit, identifying the underlying problem which prohibits these methods to reach the quantum Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound, and propose a new adaptive scheme based on covariant measurements to circumvent this problem. Our findings are carefully checked by Monte Carlo simulations, showing that the method we propose is both mathematically and experimentally more realistic and more efficient than the methods currently available.</jats:p>",

In this work, we ask: how does one detect if a channel is useful in preparing negative conditional entropy states? We answer this question by introducing the class of A-unital channels, which we show are the largest class of conditional entropy non-decreasing channels. We also prove that A-unital channels are precisely the completely free operations for the class of states with non-negative conditional entropy. Furthermore, we study the relationship between A-unital channels and other classes of channels pertinent to the resource theory of entanglement. We then prove similar results for ACVENN: a previously defined, relevant class of states and also relate the maximum and minimum conditional entropy of a state with its von Neumann entropy.\nThe definition of A-unital channels naturally lends itself to a procedure for determining membership of channels in this class. Thus, our work is valuable for the detection of resourceful channels in the context of conditional entropy.</jats:p>",

Currently, these noisy intermediate-scale devices can support a sufficient number of sequential operations prior to decoherence such that near term algorithms can be performed with proximate accuracy (like chemical accuracy for quantum chemistry problems). While the results of these algorithms are imperfect, these imperfections can help bootstrap quantum computer testbed development. Demonstrations of these algorithms over the past few years, coupled with the idea that imperfect algorithm performance can be caused by several dominant noise sources in the quantum processor, which can be measured and calibrated during algorithm execution or in post-processing, has led to the use of noise mitigation to improve typical computational results. Conversely, benchmark algorithms coupled with noise mitigation can help diagnose the nature of the noise, whether systematic or purely random. Here, we outline the use of coherent noise mitigation techniques as a characterization tool in trapped-ion testbeds. We perform model-fitting of the noisy data to determine the noise source based on realistic physics focused noise models and demonstrate that systematic noise amplification coupled with error mitigation schemes provides useful data for noise model deduction. Further, in order to connect lower level noise model details with application specific performance of near term algorithms, we experimentally construct the loss landscape of a variational algorithm under various injected noise sources coupled with error mitigation techniques. This type of connection enables application-aware hardware codesign, in which the most important noise sources in specific applications, like quantum chemistry, become foci of improvement in subsequent hardware generations.</jats:p>",

We derive lower and upper bounds in terms of the Choi operator's trace norm and obtain analytic expressions for several linear maps of practical interests. Furthermore, we endow this measure with an operational meaning within the quantum error mitigation scenario: it establishes the lower bound of the sampling cost achievable via the quasiprobability decomposition technique.

We provide numerical results which demonstrate that RLNN successfully finds the optimal local approach, even for candidate states up to 20 subsystems. We additionally demonstrate that the RLNN strategy meets or exceeds the success probability for a modified locally greedy approach in each random trial.While the use of RLNN is highly successful for designing adaptive local measurement strategies, in general a significant gap can exist between the success probability of the optimal locally-adaptive measurement strategy and the optimal collective measurement. We build on previous work to provide a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for collective protocols to strictly outperform locally adaptive protocols.

Specific to the latter, we present a framework that enables bootstrapping the VQE progression towards the convergence of the ground-state energy of the fermionic system. This framework, based on perturbation theory, is capable of improving the energy estimate at each cycle of the VQE progression, by about a factor of three closer to the known ground-state energy compared to the standard VQE approach in the test-bed, classically-accessible system of the water molecule. The improved energy estimate in turn results in a commensurate level of savings of quantum resources, such as the number of qubits and quantum gates, required to be within a pre-specified tolerance from the known ground-state energy.

Several generation procedures, which use either interacting quantum emitters or efficient spin-photon interface, have been proposed to create these photonic graph states deterministically. Yet, these solutions are still out of reach experimentally since the state-of-the-art is the generation of a linear graph state. Here, we introduce near-deterministic solutions for the generation of graph states using the current quantum emitter capabilities.

Error correction allows for deeper circuits to be run, but each additional physical qubit can potentially contribute an exponential increase in computational space, so there is a trade-off between using qubits for error correction or using them as noisy qubits. In this work we look at the effects of using noisy qubits in conjunction with noiseless qubits (an idealized model for error-corrected qubits), which we call the \"clean and dirty\" setup. We employ analytical models and numerical simulations to characterize this setup. Numerically we show the appearance of Noise-Induced Barren Plateaus (NIBPs), i.e., an exponential concentration of observables caused by noise, in an Ising model Hamiltonian variational ansatz circuit. We observe this even if only a single qubit is noisy and given a deep enough circuit, suggesting that NIBPs cannot be fully overcome simply by error-correcting a subset of the qubits. On the positive side, we find that for every noiseless qubit in the circuit, there is an exponential suppression in concentration of gradient observables, showing the benefit of partial error correction. Finally, our analytical models corroborate these findings by showing that observables concentrate with a scaling in the exponent related to the ratio of dirty-to-total qubits.</jats:p>",

This leads to the notion of `decomposable' and `non-decomposable' quantum coherence and gives a new perspective on recent results in the theory of asymmetry as well as early analysis in the theory of classical random variables. Within the context of recent fluctuation relations, originally framed in terms of quantum channels, we show that coherent work processes play the same role as their classical counterparts, and so provide a simple physical primitive for quantum coherence in such systems. We also introduce a pure state effective potential as a tool with which to analyze the coherent component of these fluctuation relations, and which leads to a notion of temperature-dependent mean coherence, provides connections with multi-partite entanglement, and gives a hierarchy of quantum corrections to the classical Crooks relation in powers of inverse temperature.</jats:p>",

We can think of them as idealized, infinite-mass subsystems which decouple from the rest of the system. In nature, however, all reference frames are realized through finite-mass systems that are subject to the laws of quantum mechanics and must be included in the dynamical evolution. A fundamental physical theory should take this fact seriously. In this paper, we further develop a symmetry-inspired approach to describe physics from the perspective of quantum reference frames. We find a unifying framework allowing us to systematically derive a broad class of perspective dependent descriptions and the transformations between them. Working with a translational-invariant toy model of three free particles, we discover that the introduction of relative coordinates leads to a Hamiltonian structure with two non-commuting constraints. This structure can be said to contain all observer-perspectives at once, while the redundancies prevent an immediate operational interpretation. We show that the operationally meaningful perspective dependent descriptions are given by Darboux coordinates on the constraint surface and that reference frame transformations correspond to reparametrizations of the constraint surface. We conclude by constructing a quantum perspective neutral structure, via which we can derive and change perspective dependent descriptions without referring to the classical theory. In addition to the physical findings, this work illuminates the interrelation of first and second class constrained systems and their respective quantization procedures.</jats:p>",

This task of state exclusion has recently been studied at length in \\cite{bandyopadhyay2014conclusive}, and it is at the heart of the celebrated PBR thought experiment \\cite{pusey2012reality}. When all the preparations correspond to pure states and there are no more of them than their common dimension, it is an open problem whether POVMs give any additional power for this task with respect to projective measurements. This is the case even for the simple case of three states in three dimensions, which is mentioned in \\cite{caves2002conditions} as unsuccessfully tackled. In this paper, we give an analytical proof that in this case considering POVMs does indeed not give any additional power with respect to projective measurements. To do so, we first make without loss of generality some assumptions about the structure of an optimal POVM. The justification of these assumptions involves arguments based on convexity, rank and symmetry properties. We show then that any pure states perfectly excluded by such a POVM meet the conditions identified in \\cite{caves2002conditions} for perfect exclusion by a projective measurement of three pure states in three dimensions.

This allows us to simulate small but numerous terms using QDrift while simulating the larger terms using a high-order Trotter-Suzuki formula. We prove rigorous bounds on the diamond distance between the Composite channel and the ideal simulation channel and show under what conditions the cost of implementing the Composite channel is asymptotically upper bounded by the methods that comprise it for both probabilistic partitioning of terms and deterministic partitioning.

So far, apart from the limit of vanishing error rates, rigorous results have only been established for some specific codes.\nIn this work, we rigorously resolve the question for arbitrary stabilizer codes. The main result is that a stabilizer code can be used to estimate Pauli channels with correlations across a number of qubits given by the pure distance. This result does not rely on the limit of vanishing error rates, and applies even if high weight errors occur frequently. Moreover, it also allows for measurement errors within the framework of quantum data-syndrome codes. Our proof combines Boolean Fourier analysis, combinatorics and elementary algebraic geometry.

Based on this, we prove a structure theorem for operational probabilistic theories, showing that the set of states of any system decomposes as a direct sum of perfectly discriminable sets, and such decomposition is preserved under system composition. As a consequence, a theory is such that any information can be extracted without disturbance only if all its systems are classical. Finally, we show via concrete examples that no-information without disturbance is independent of both local discriminability and purification.</jats:p>",

For the simulation of the time evolution, several efficient quantum algorithms have recently been developed. However, computing the non-equilibrium steady state as the long-time limit of the system dynamics is often not a viable solution, because of exceedingly long transient features or strong quantum correlations in the dynamics. Here, we develop an efficient quantum algorithm for the direct estimation of averaged expectation values of observables on the non-equilibrium steady state, thus bypassing the time integration of the master equation. The algorithm encodes the vectorized representation of the density matrix on a quantum register, and makes use of quantum phase estimation to approximate the eigenvector associated to the zero eigenvalue of the generator of the system dynamics. We show that the output state of the algorithm allows to estimate expectation values of observables on the steady state. Away from critical points, where the Liouvillian gap scales as a power law of the system size, the quantum algorithm performs with exponential advantage compared to exact diagonalization.</jats:p>",

Here, we give a concrete way to find uncorrelated measurement strategies with optimal precisions. We solve this fundamental problem by introducing a framework of conic programming that unifies the theory of precision bounds for multiparameter estimates for uncorrelated and correlated measurement strategies under a common umbrella. Namely, we give precision bounds that arise from linear programs on various cones defined on a tensor product space of matrices, including a particular cone of separable matrices. Subsequently, our theory allows us to develop an efficient algorithm that calculates both upper and lower bounds for the ultimate precision bound for uncorrelated measurement strategies, where these bounds can be tight. In particular, the uncorrelated measurement strategy that arises from our theory saturates the upper bound to the ultimate precision bound. Also, we show numerically that there is a strict gap between the previous efficiently computable bounds and the ultimate precision bound.</jats:p>",

We say that a Bell inequality is normalized if its absolute value does not exceed 1 for any classical (i.e. local) distribution. Upper and (almost) tight lower bounds have been given for the quantum violation of these Bell inequalities in terms of number of outputs of the distribution, number of inputs, and the dimension of the shared quantum states. In this work, we revisit normalized Bell inequalities together with another family: inefficiency-resistant Bell inequalities. To be inefficiency-resistant, the Bell value must not exceed 1 for any local distribution, including those that can abort. This makes the Bell inequality resistant to the detection loophole, while a normalized Bell inequality is resistant to general local noise. Both these families of Bell inequalities are closely related to communication complexity lower bounds. We show how to derive large violations from any gap between classical and quantum communication complexity, provided the lower bound on classical communication is proven using these lower bound techniques. This leads to inefficiency-resistant violations that can be exponential in the size of the inputs. Finally, we study resistance to noise and inefficiency for these Bell inequalities.</jats:p>",

Many efforts have been made to realise certain forms of quantum advantage in this problem, for instance, the development of variational quantum algorithms. A recent work by Huggins et al. [1] reports a novel candidate, i.e. a quantum-classical hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm with a reduced bias in comparison to its fully-classical counterpart. In this paper, we propose a family of scalable quantum-assisted Monte Carlo algorithms where the quantum computer is used at its minimal cost and still can reduce the bias. By incorporating a Bayesian inference approach, we can achieve this quantum-facilitated bias reduction with a much smaller quantum-computing cost than taking empirical mean in amplitude estimation. Besides, we show that the hybrid Monte Carlo framework is a general way to suppress errors in the ground state obtained from classical algorithms. Our work provides a Monte Carlo toolkit for achieving quantum-enhanced calculation of fermion systems on near-term quantum devices.</jats:p>",

In particular, the ground space is thought to yield a quantum error-correcting code. We offer an explicit proof that this is the case for arbitrary finite groups. Actually a stronger claim is shown: any two states with zero energy density in some contractible region must have the same reduced state in that region. Alternatively, the local properties of a gauge-invariant state are fully determined by specifying that its holonomies in the region are trivial. We contrast this result with the fact that local properties of gauge-invariant states are not generally determined by specifying all of their non-Abelian fluxes --- that is, the Wilson loops of lattice gauge theory do not form a complete commuting set of observables. We also note that the methods developed by P. Naaijkens (PhD thesis, 2012) under a different context can be adapted to provide another proof of the error correcting property of Kitaev's model. Finally, we compute the topological entanglement entropy in Kitaev's model, and show, contrary to previous claims in the literature, that it does not depend on whether the ``log dim R'' term is included in the definition of entanglement entropy.</jats:p>",

We propose a method for learning how to construct these gates efficiently by using the simulator to perform optimal control on itself. This bypasses two major problems of purely classical approaches to the control problem: the need to have an accurate model of the system, and a classical computer more powerful than the quantum one to carry out the required simulations. Strong evidence that the scheme scales polynomially in the number of qubits, for systems of up to 9 qubits with Ising interactions, is presented from numerical simulations carried out in different topologies. This suggests that this in situ approach is a practical way of upgrading quantum simulators to computers.</jats:p>",

We present a trap-based verification scheme for quantum supremacy that only requires the verifier to prepare single-qubit states. The verification is done on the same model as the original sampler, a square lattice, with only a constant overhead. We next revamp our verification scheme in two distinct ways using fault tolerance that preserves the nonadaptivity. The first has a lower overhead based on error correction with the same threshold as universal quantum computation.

Secondly, finding a polynomial time function to distinguish the output of random circuits from the uniform distribution can also spoof the heavy output generation problem in polynomial time. This pinpoints that exponential resources may be unavoidable for even the most basic verification tasks in the setting of random quantum circuits. Beyond this setting, by employing strong data processing inequalities, our framework allows us to analyse the effect of noise on classical simulability and verification of more general near-term quantum advantage proposals.</jats:p>",

However, it is challenging to devise a suitable LQN that carries a specific entangled state or compute the possible entangled state in a given LQN as the particle and mode number increase. This research presents a mapping process of arbitrary LQNs to graphs, which provides a powerful tool for analyzing and designing LQNs to generate multipartite entanglement. We also introduce the perfect matching diagram (PM diagram), which is a refined directed graph that includes all the essential information on the entanglement generation by an LQN.

Here, we answer this question in a theory-independent way using General Probabilistic Theories (GPTs). We consider the interactions of the gravitational field with a single matter system, and derive a no-go theorem showing that when gravity is classical at least one of the following assumptions needs to be violated: (i) Matter degrees of freedom are described by fully non-classical degrees of freedom; (ii) Interactions between matter degrees of freedom and the gravitational field are reversible; (iii) Matter degrees of freedom back-react on the gravitational field. We argue that this implies that theories of classical gravity and quantum matter must be fundamentally irreversible, as is the case in the recent model of Oppenheim et al. Conversely if we require that the interaction between quantum matter and the gravitational field is reversible, then the gravitational field must be non-classical.</jats:p>",

This description, however, does not directly define its action on non-unitary operations. The action of the quantum switch on non-unitary operations is then chosen to be a ``natural'' extension of its action on unitary operations. In general, the action of a process on non-unitary operations is not uniquely determined by its action on unitary operations. It may be that there could be a set of inequivalent extensions of the quantum switch for non-unitary operations. We prove, however, that the natural extension is the only possibility for the quantum switch for the 2-slot case. In other words, contrary to the general case, the action of the quantum switch on non-unitary operations (as a linear and completely CP preserving supermap) is completely determined by its action on unitary operations. We also discuss the general problem of when the complete description of a quantum process is uniquely determined by its action on unitary operations and identify a set of single-slot processes which are completely defined by their action on unitary operations.</jats:p>",

This motivates the consideration of multipartite \"noncausal\" correlations that cannot be realised even if noncausal resources are made available to a smaller number of parties. Here we formalise this notion: genuinely N-partite noncausal correlations are those that cannot be produced by grouping N parties into two or more subsets, where a causal order between the subsets exists. We prove that such correlations can be characterised as lying outside a polytope, whose vertices correspond to deterministic strategies and whose facets define what we call \"2-causal\" inequalities. We show that genuinely multipartite noncausal correlations arise within the process matrix formalism, where quantum mechanics holds locally but no global causal structure is assumed, although for some inequalities no violation was found. We further introduce two refined definitions that allow one to quantify, in different ways, to what extent noncausal correlations correspond to a genuinely multipartite resource.</jats:p>",

Our approach based on continuous dissipation is able not only to reproduce the dynamics of previous proposals of quantum reservoir computing, based on discontinuous erasing maps but also to enhance their performance. Control of the damping rates is shown to boost popular machine learning temporal tasks as the capability to linearly and non-linearly process the input history and to forecast chaotic series. Finally, we formally prove that, under non-restrictive conditions, our dissipative models form a universal class for reservoir computing.

In recent years, there have been significant advancements in the development of near-term quantum algorithms for quantum simulation, including VQE and many of its variants. However, for such algorithms to be useful, they need to overcome several critical barriers including the inability to prepare high-quality approximations of the ground state. Current challenges to state preparation, including barren plateaus and the high-dimensionality of the optimization landscape, make state preparation through ansatz optimization unreliable. In this work, we introduce the method of ground state boosting, which uses a limited-depth quantum circuit to reliably increase the overlap with the ground state. This circuit, which we call a booster, can be used to augment an ansatz from VQE or be used as a stand-alone state preparation method. The booster converts circuit depth into ground state overlap in a controllable manner. We numerically demonstrate the capabilities of boosters by simulating the performance of a particular type of booster, namely the Gaussian booster, for preparing the ground state of <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math> molecular system.

Here, we discuss a model where topology emerges from the quantum interference between single-particle dynamics and global interactions. The system is composed by soft-core bosons that interact via global correlated hopping in a one-dimensional lattice. The onset of quantum interference leads to spontaneous breaking of the lattice translational symmetry, the corresponding phase resembles nontrivial states of the celebrated Su-Schriefer-Heeger model. Like the fermionic Peierls instability, the emerging quantum phase is a topological insulator and is found at half fillings. Originating from quantum interference, this topological phase is found in \"exact\" density-matrix renormalization group calculations and is entirely absent in the mean-field approach. We argue that these dynamics can be realized in existing experimental platforms, such as cavity quantum electrodynamics setups, where the topological features can be revealed in the light emitted by the resonator.</jats:p>",

We investigate the transversal gates that can be implemented in hypergraph product codes, a class of LDPC codes. Our analysis is aided by the construction of a symplectic canonical basis for the logical operators of hypergraph product codes, a result that may be of independent interest. We show that in these codes transversal gates can implement Hadamard (up to logical SWAP gates) and control-Z on all logical qubits. Moreover, we show that sequences of transversal operations, interleaved with error correction, allow implementation of entangling gates between arbitrary pairs of logical qubits in the same code block.

This makes it possible to utilize the measurement error mitigation framework to mitigate the errors caused by the generalized Pauli channels. We use this result to mitigate noise on the probe states and recover the scaling of the noiseless probes, except with a noise strength-dependent constant factor.

This is most pronounced for low mass, high frequency systems \u2013 convenient for reaching the quantum regime \u2013 and can lead to improvements of several orders of magnitude, as well as a broadening of the measurement window. Nevertheless, significant obstacles still remain. In particular, we find that modulations increase decoherence effects at the same rate as the entanglement improvements. This adds to the growing evidence that the constraint on noise (acting on the position d.o.f) depends only on the particle mass, separation, and temperature of the environment and cannot be improved by novel quantum control. Finally, we highlight the close connection between the observation of quantum correlations and the limits of measurement precision derived via the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound. An immediate consequence is that probing superpositions of the gravitational field places similar demands on detector sensitivity as entanglement verification.</jats:p>",

To navigate through this jumble, we introduce a non-physical simplification of quantum maps that we refer to as the leading Kraus (LK) approximation. The uncluttered parameterization of LK approximated maps naturally suggests the introduction of a unitary-decoherent polar factorization for quantum channels in any dimension. We then leverage this structural dichotomy to bound the evolution -- as circuits grow in depth -- of two of the most experimentally relevant figures of merit, namely the average process fidelity and the unitarity.

Our method yields a non-perturbative numerical simulation algorithm for generic linear NMSSE that can be made arbitrarily accurate for reasonably short times.

A logical proof of the KS theorem is one that relies only on the compatibility relations amongst a set of projectors (a KS set) to witness this inconsistency. These compatibility relations can be represented by a hypergraph, referred to as a contextuality scenario. Here we consider contextuality scenarios that we term KS-uncolourable, e.g., those which appear in logical proofs of the KS theorem. We introduce a hypergraph framework to obtain noise-robust witnesses of contextuality from such scenarios.\nOur approach builds on the results of R. Kunjwal and R. W. Spekkens, Phys. Rev.

It is important that the relation is given with well-defined and easily measurable quantities, and that it does not need assuming infinite dimensional systems. Based on this uncertainty relation, we show how to detect bipartite entanglement in an unpolarized Dicke state of many spin-1/2 particles. The particles are split into two subensembles, then collective angular momentum measurements are carried out locally on the two parts. First, we present a bipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering criterion. Then, we present an entanglement condition that can detect bipartite entanglement in such systems. We demonstrate the utility of the criteria by applying them to a recent experiment given in K. Lange et al. [Science 360, 416 (2018)] realizing a Dicke state in a Bose-Einstein condensate of cold atoms, in which the two subensembles were spatially separated from each other. Our methods also work well if split spin-squeezed states are considered. We show in a comprehensive way how to handle experimental imperfections, such as the nonzero particle number variance including the partition noise, and the fact that, while ideally BECs occupy a single spatial mode, in practice the population of other spatial modes cannot be fully suppressed.</jats:p>",

Here, we demonstrate the advantage of co-developing and integrating simulators and compilers by proposing a specialized compiler pass to reduce the simulation time for arbitrary circuits. While the concept is broadly applicable, we present a concrete implementation based on the Intel Quantum Simulator, a high-performance distributed simulator. As part of this work, we extend its implementation with additional functionalities related to the representation of quantum states. The communication overhead is reduced by changing the order in which state amplitudes are stored in the distributed memory, a concept analogous to the distinction between local and global qubits for distributed Schroedinger-type simulators. We then implement a compiler pass to exploit the novel functionalities by introducing special instructions governing data movement as part of the quantum circuit. Those instructions target unique capabilities of simulators and have no analogue in actual quantum devices. To quantify the advantage, we compare the time required to simulate random circuits with and without our optimization. The simulation time is typically halved.</jats:p>",

These native gates often have a parameterization (e.g., rotation angles) which provide the ability to perform a continuous range of operations. Verification of the correct operation of these gates across the allowable range of parameters is important for gaining confidence in the reliability of these devices. In this work, we demonstrate a procedure for sample-efficient verification of continuously-parameterized quantum gates for small quantum processors of up to approximately 10 qubits. This procedure involves generating random sequences of randomly-parameterized layers of gates chosen from the native gate set of the device, and then stochastically compiling an approximate inverse to this sequence such that executing the full sequence on the device should leave the system near its initial state. We show that fidelity estimates made via this technique have a lower variance than fidelity estimates made via cross-entropy benchmarking. This provides an experimentally-relevant advantage in sample efficiency when estimating the fidelity loss to some desired precision. We describe the experimental realization of this technique using continuously-parameterized quantum gate sets on a trapped-ion quantum processor from Sandia QSCOUT and a superconducting quantum processor from IBM Q, and we demonstrate the sample efficiency advantage of this technique both numerically and experimentally.</jats:p>",

Among these, problem-tailored versions such as ADAPT-VQE that build variational ans\u00e4tze step by step from a predefined operator pool perform particularly well in terms of circuit depths and variational parameter counts. However, this improved performance comes at the expense of an additional measurement overhead compared to standard VQEs.

However, at their early stage, an atom or emitter in a cavity system with different channels to the environment and additional noise are insufficient to produce negative Wigner functions. Moreover, homodyne detection is frequently challenging for such experiments. We analyse these issues and prove that such cavities can be used to emit quantum non-Gaussian light employing single-photon detection in the Hanbury Brown and Twiss configuration and quantum non-Gaussianity criteria suitable for this measurement. We investigate in detail cases of considerable cavity leakage when the negativity of the Wigner function disappears completely.

Such resources are often studied using nonlocal games, semiquantum games, entanglement-witnesses, teleportation experiments, and similar tasks. We introduce a unifying framework which subsumes the full range of nonsignaling resources, as well as the games and experiments which probe them, into a common resource theory: that of local operations and shared randomness (LOSR). Crucially, we allow these LOSR operations to locally change the type of a resource, so that players can convert resources of <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:math> type into resources of any other type, and in particular into strategies for the specific type of game they are playing.

On the other hand, the one-shot information-theoretic entropies, such as the smooth min/max-entropies, are less discussed in AdS/CFT. They are however more fundamental entropy measures from the quantum information perspective and should also play pivotal roles in holography. We combine the technical methods from both quantum information and quantum gravity to put this idea on firm grounds. In particular, we study the quantum extremal surface (QES) prescription that was recently revised to highlight the significance of one-shot entropies in characterizing the QES phase transition. Motivated by the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP), we derive the refined quantum extremal surface prescription for fixed-area states via a novel AEP replica trick, demonstrating the synergy between quantum information and quantum gravity. We further prove that, when restricted to pure bulk marginal states, such corrections do not occur for the higher R\u00e9nyi entropies of a boundary subregion in fixed-area states, meaning they always have sharp QES transitions. Our path integral derivation suggests that the refinement applies beyond AdS/CFT, and we confirm it in a black hole toy model by showing that the Page curve, for a black hole in a superposition of two radiation stages, receives a large correction that is consistent with the refined QES prescription.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Physical observation is made relative to a reference frame. A reference frame is essentially a quantum system given the universal validity of quantum mechanics. Thus, a quantum system must be described relative to a quantum reference frame (QRF). Further requirements on QRF include using only relational observables and not assuming the existence of external reference frame. To address these requirements, two approaches are proposed in the literature. The first one is an operational approach (F. Giacomini, et al, Nat. Comm. 10:494, 2019) which focuses on the quantization of transformation between QRFs. The second approach attempts to derive the quantum transformation between QRFs from first principles (A. Vanrietvelde, et al,<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"><mml:mtext class=\"MJX-tex-mathit\" mathvariant=\"italic\">Quantum</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math>4:225, 2020). Such first principle approach describes physical systems as symmetry induced constrained Hamiltonian systems. The Dirac quantization of such systems before removing redundancy is interpreted as perspective-neutral description. Then, a systematic redundancy reduction procedure is introduced to derive description from perspective of a QRF. The first principle approach recovers some of the results from the operational approach, but not yet include an important part of a quantum theory - the measurement theory. This paper is intended to bridge the gap. We show that the von Neumann quantum measurement theory can be embedded into the perspective-neutral framework. This allows us to successfully recover the results found in the operational approach, with the advantage that the transformation operator can be derived from the first principle. In addition, the formulation presented here reveals several interesting conceptual insights. For instance, the projection operation in measurement needs to be performed after redundancy reduction, and the projection operator must be transformed accordingly when switching QRFs. These results represent one step forward in understanding how quantum measurement should be formulated when the reference frame is also a quantum system.</jats:p>",

Beyond the study of the suitability of the ansatz to approximate the ground states of many-boson systems, we also perform initial evaluations of the use of the ansatz in a variational quantum eigensolver algorithm to find it through energy minimization. To this end we also introduce a scheme to measure the Hamiltonian energy in an experimental system, and study the effect of sampling noise.</jats:p>",

Both fields thereby face the question of how to describe physics relative to quantum reference systems and how the descriptions relative to different such choices are related. Here, we exploit a fruitful interplay of ideas from both fields to begin developing a unifying approach to transformations among quantum reference systems that ultimately aims at encompassing both quantum and gravitational physics. In particular, using a gravity inspired symmetry principle, which enforces physical observables to be relational and leads to an inherent redundancy in the description, we develop a perspective-neutral structure, which contains all frame perspectives at once and via which they are changed. We show that taking the perspective of a specific frame amounts to a fixing of the symmetry related redundancies in both the classical and quantum theory and that changing perspective corresponds to a symmetry transformation. We implement this using the language of constrained systems, which naturally encodes symmetries. Within a simple one-dimensional model, we recover some of the quantum frame transformations of \\cite{Giacomini:2017zju}, embedding them in a perspective-neutral framework. Using them, we illustrate how entanglement and classicality of an observed system depend on the quantum frame perspective. Our operational language also inspires a new interpretation of Dirac and reduced quantized theories within our model as perspective-neutral and perspectival quantum theories, respectively, and reveals the explicit link between them.

Here, we address the question of whether error-uncorrected noisy quantum computers can provide computational advantage over classical computers. Specifically, we study noisy random circuit sampling in one dimension (or 1D noisy RCS) as a simple model for exploring the effects of noise on the computational power of a noisy quantum device. In particular, we simulate the real-time dynamics of 1D noisy random quantum circuits via matrix product operators (MPOs) and characterize the computational power of the 1D noisy quantum system by using a metric we call MPO entanglement entropy. The latter metric is chosen because it determines the cost of classical MPO simulation. We numerically demonstrate that for the two-qubit gate error rates we considered, there exists a characteristic system size above which adding more qubits does not bring about an exponential growth of the cost of classical MPO simulation of 1D noisy systems. Specifically, we show that above the characteristic system size, there is an optimal circuit depth, independent of the system size, where the MPO entanglement entropy is maximized. Most importantly, the maximum achievable MPO entanglement entropy is bounded by a constant that depends only on the gate error rate, not on the system size. We also provide a heuristic analysis to get the scaling of the maximum achievable MPO entanglement entropy as a function of the gate error rate. The obtained scaling suggests that although the cost of MPO simulation does not increase exponentially in the system size above a certain characteristic system size, it does increase exponentially as the gate error rate decreases, possibly making classical simulation practically not feasible even with state-of-the-art supercomputers.</jats:p>",

This modified assumption is physically better motivated than a dimension bound and closer to the description of actual experiments. In particular, we consider quantum optical schemes where the source emits quantum states described in an infinite-dimensional Fock space and model our assumption as an upper bound on the average photon number in the emitted states. We characterize the set of correlations that may be exhibited in the simplest possible scenario compatible with our new framework, based on two energy-constrained state preparations and a two-outcome measurement. Interestingly, we uncover the existence of quantum correlations exceeding the set of classical correlations that can be produced by devices behaving in a purely pre-determined fashion (possibly including shared randomness). This feature suggests immediate applications to certified randomness generation. Along this line, we analyze the achievable correlations in several prepare-and-measure optical schemes with a mean photon number constraint and demonstrate that they allow for the generation of certified randomness.

Here, we present the first demonstration of indefinite temporal order outside of quantum formalism. We show that our experimental outcomes are incompatible with a class of generalised probabilistic theories satisfying the assumptions of locality and definite temporal order. To this end, we derive physical constraints (in the form of a Bell-like inequality) on experimental outcomes within such a class of theories. We then experimentally invalidate these theories by violating the inequality using entangled temporal order. This provides experimental evidence that there exist correlations in nature which are incompatible with the assumptions of locality and definite temporal order.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Dynamically field-programmable qubit arrays (DPQA) have recently emerged as a promising platform for quantum information processing. In DPQA, atomic qubits are selectively loaded into arrays of optical traps that can be reconfigured during the computation itself. Leveraging qubit transport and parallel, entangling quantum operations, different pairs of qubits, even those initially far away, can be entangled at different stages of the quantum program execution. Such reconfigurability and non-local connectivity present new challenges for compilation, especially in the layout synthesis step which places and routes the qubits and schedules the gates. In this paper, we consider a DPQA architecture that contains multiple arrays and supports 2D array movements, representing cutting-edge experimental platforms. Within this architecture, we discretize the state space and formulate layout synthesis as a satisfiability modulo theories problem, which can be solved by existing solvers optimally in terms of circuit depth. For a set of benchmark circuits generated by random graphs with complex connectivities, our compiler OLSQ-DPQA reduces the number of two-qubit entangling gates on small problem instances by 1.7x compared to optimal compilation results on a fixed planar architecture. To further improve scalability and practicality of the method, we introduce a greedy heuristic inspired by the iterative peeling approach in classical integrated circuit routing. Using a hybrid approach that combined the greedy and optimal methods, we demonstrate that our DPQA-based compiled circuits feature reduced scaling overhead compared to a grid fixed architecture, resulting in 5.1X less two-qubit gates for 90 qubit quantum circuits. These methods enable programmable, complex quantum circuits with neutral atom quantum computers, as well as informing both future compilers and future hardware choices.</jats:p>",

This violation can be achieved both for small systems but also for macroscopic many-body systems, and leads to positive work extraction per particle with finite probability from macroscopic states in equilibrium. In addition to studying such violations for a single system, we also discuss the scenario in which many parties use the same catalyst to induce local transitions. We show that there exist catalytic processes that lead to highly correlated work distributions, expected to have implications for stochastic and quantum thermodynamics.</jats:p>",

We derive conditions for the interconversion of these resources, which generalise the first law of thermodynamics. We study reversibility conditions for multi-resource theories, and find that the relative entropy distances from the invariant sets of the theory play a fundamental role in the quantification of the resources. The first law for general multi-resource theories is a single relation which links the change in the properties of the system during a state transformation and the weighted sum of the resources exchanged. In fact, this law can be seen as relating the change in the relative entropy from different sets of states. In contrast to typical single-resource theories, the notion of free states and invariant sets of states become distinct in light of multiple constraints. Additionally, generalisations of the Helmholtz free energy, and of adiabatic and isothermal transformations, emerge. We thus have a set of laws for general quantum resource theories, which generalise the laws of thermodynamics. We first test this approach on thermodynamics with multiple conservation laws, and then apply it to the theory of local operations under energetic restrictions.</jats:p>",

Due to the complex potential, the evolution mixes real- and imaginary-time propagation and the wave function can potentially be continuously absorbed during the time propagation. We use the dilation quantum algorithm to treat the imaginary-time evolution in parallel to the real-time propagation. This method has the advantage of using only one reservoir qubit at a time, that is measured with a certain success probability to implement the desired imaginary-time evolution. We propose a specific prescription for the dilation method where the success probability is directly linked to the physical norm of the continuously absorbed state evolving on the mesh. We expect that the proposed prescription will have the advantage of keeping a high probability of success in most physical situations. Applications of the method are made on one-dimensional wave functions evolving on a mesh. Results obtained on a quantum computer identify with those obtained on a classical computer.

As an example, we apply our framework to purported photonic implementations of the quantum switch to show that while their coarse-grained causal structure is cyclic, their fine-grained causal structure is acyclic.

We find two phases of topological amplification, both with directional transport and exponential gain with the number of sites, and one of them featuring squeezing. We also find a topologically trivial phase with zero-energy modes which produces amplification but lacks the robust topological protection of the others. We characterize the resilience to disorder of the different phases and their stability, gain, and noise-to-signal ratio. Finally, we discuss their experimental implementation with state-of-the-art techniques.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past three decades significant reductions have been made to the cost of estimating ground-state energies of molecular Hamiltonians with quantum computers. However, comparatively little attention has been paid to estimating the expectation values of other observables with respect to said ground states, which is important for many industrial applications. In this work we present a novel expectation value estimation (EVE) quantum algorithm which can be applied to estimate the expectation values of arbitrary observables with respect to any of the system&amp;apos;s eigenstates. In particular, we consider two variants of EVE: std-EVE, based on standard quantum phase estimation, and QSP-EVE, which utilizes quantum signal processing (QSP) techniques. We provide rigorous error analysis for both both variants and minimize the number of individual phase factors for QSPEVE. These error analyses enable us to produce constant-factor quantum resource estimates for both std-EVE and QSP-EVE across a variety of molecular systems and observables. For the systems considered, we show that QSP-EVE reduces (Toffoli) gate counts by up to three orders of magnitude and reduces qubit width by up to 25% compared to std-EVE. While estimated resource counts remain far too high for the first generations of fault-tolerant quantum computers, our estimates mark a first of their kind for both the application of expectation value estimation and modern QSP-based techniques.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, tremendous progress has been made in the field of quantum science and technologies: different platforms for quantum simulation as well as quantum computing, ranging from superconducting qubits to neutral atoms, are starting to reach unprecedentedly large systems. In order to benchmark these systems and gain physical insights, the need for efficient tools to characterize quantum states arises. The exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size renders a full reconstruction of the quantum state prohibitively demanding in terms of the number of necessary measurements. Here we propose and implement an efficient scheme for quantum state tomography using active learning. Based on a few initial measurements, the active learning protocol proposes the next measurement basis, designed to yield the maximum information gain. We apply the active learning quantum state tomography scheme to reconstruct different multi-qubit states with varying degree of entanglement as well as to ground states of the XXZ model in 1D and a kinetically constrained spin chain. In all cases, we obtain a significantly improved reconstruction as compared to a reconstruction based on the exact same number of measurements and measurement configurations, but with randomly chosen basis configurations. Our scheme is highly relevant to gain physical insights in quantum many-body systems as well as for benchmarking and characterizing quantum devices, e.g. for quantum simulation, and paves the way for scalable adaptive protocols to probe, prepare, and manipulate quantum systems.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Gate set tomography (GST) is a protocol for detailed, predictive characterization of logic operations (gates) on quantum computing processors. Early versions of GST emerged around 2012-13, and since then it has been refined, demonstrated, and used in a large number of experiments. This paper presents the foundations of GST in comprehensive detail. The most important feature of GST, compared to older state and process tomography protocols, is that it is <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"><mml:mtext class=\"MJX-tex-mathit\" mathvariant=\"italic\">calibration-free</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math>. GST does not rely on pre-calibrated state preparations and measurements. Instead, it characterizes all the operations in a <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"><mml:mtext class=\"MJX-tex-mathit\" mathvariant=\"italic\">gate set</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math> simultaneously and self-consistently, relative to each other. Long sequence GST can estimate gates with very high precision and efficiency, achieving Heisenberg scaling in regimes of practical interest. In this paper, we cover GST's intellectual history, the techniques and experiments used to achieve its intended purpose, data analysis, gauge freedom and fixing, error bars, and the interpretation of gauge-fixed estimates of gate sets. Our focus is fundamental mathematical aspects of GST, rather than implementation details, but we touch on some of the foundational algorithmic tricks used in the <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"><mml:mtext mathvariant=\"monospace\">pyGSTi</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math> implementation.</jats:p>",
