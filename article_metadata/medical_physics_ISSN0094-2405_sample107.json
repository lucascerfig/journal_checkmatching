The 3D reconstruction technique is based on an iterative nonrigid registration of the features extracted from a statistically instantiated 3D surface model to those interactively identified from the radiographs. The surface models reconstructed from the radiographs were compared to the associated ground truths derived either from a 3D CT\u2010scan reconstruction method or from a 3D laser\u2010scan reconstruction method and an average error distance of 0.95 mm were found. Compared to the existing works, our approach has the advantage of seamlessly handling both nonpathologic and pathologic cases even when the statistical shape model that we used was constructed from surface models of nonpathologic bones.</jats:p>",

In the frame work of the PROSCAN project a dedicated superconducting cyclotron (COMET) is in clinical operation since February 2007. The aim of OPTIS2 project, an entirely new facility for the treatment ocular tumors with COMET, is to match the clinical success of OPTIS. Using the COMET/PROSCAN facility the beam intensity at the start of the OPTIS2 nozzle is 30 times lower than that currently used at the OPTIS facility. If we would keep using the OPTIS nozzle the treatment time would increase dramatically. Therefore, the new nozzle utilizes a double scattering technique with multiple\u2010ring second\u2010scattering foils which increases the nozzle efficiency by factor of 10, keeping the maximum treatment time under one minute. Due to the difference in scattering techniques the OPTIS2 and OPTIS beams are not identical. But the major characteristics, distal\u2010 and lateral\u2010 dose fall\u2010off are comparable. The flatness and symmetry have actually been improved. In OPTIS2 reliance on a single analog X\u2010ray film provider and extensive operator experience will be diminished by introducing digital imaging and computer aided semi\u2010automatic patient positioning. A new imaging and patient positioning concept has been developed, bringing together techniques and software already clinically tested at the Center de Protontherapie Orsay (France) and the Hahn Meitner Institut (Germany). OPTIS2 is designed and built from scratch, providing a continuation of the existing proton therapy program OPTIS, with comparable beam characteristics, whilst obtaining its protons from COMET. Beam commissioning and system testing is currently underway. A first patient treatment is scheduled for summer 2008.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques for three\u2010dimensional (3D) imaging of a position\u2010sensitive detector for brachytherapy dosimetry. The detector is a 0.5 l chamber containing an emulsion of halocarbon\u2010115 droplets in a tissue\u2010equivalent glycerin\u2010based gel. The halocarbon droplets are highly superheated and expand into vapor microbubbles upon irradiation. Brachytherapy sources can be inserted into the superheated emulsion chamber to create distributions of bubbles. Three\u2010dimensional MRI of the chamber is then performed. A 3D gradient\u2010echo technique was optimized for spatial resolution and contrast between bubbles and gel. Susceptibility gradients at the interfaces between bubbles and gel are exploited to enhance contrast so microscopic bubbles can be imaged using relatively large voxel sizes. Three\u2010dimensional gradient\u2010echo images are obtained with an isotropic resolution of 300 \u03bcm over a <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8441-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8441:mp8441-math-0001\" /> field\u2010of\u2010view in an imaging time of 14 min.

X\u2010ray capillary optics, aligned between the breast and CR phosphor imaging plate, will capture primary x\u2010ray photons almost exclusively.

The model, developed prior to the advent of multidetector CT scanners, is still widely used; however, it does not account for the effect of anode tilt on the penumbra or include the heel effect, both of which are increasingly important for the wider beams (up to <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2507-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp2507:mp2507-math-0002\" />) of contemporary, multidetector scanners.

Comparison of simulated and measured dose data provides experimental validation of the model, including verification of the superior match to the penumbra provided by the tilted\u2010anode model, as well as the observable effects on the cumulative dose distribution. The initial motivation for the model was to simulate the quasiperiodic dose distribution on the peripheral, phantom axes resulting from a helical scan series in order to facilitate the implementation of an improved method of CT dose measurement utilizing a short ion chamber, as proposed by Dixon [Med.

The present state of the art is slow and technique intensive, which can add to patient discomfort and inconvenience during molding and fabrication. A new formulation is described, which offers speed and ease of forming a moldable composite stent especially for intraoral use. Interleaved stacks of calibrated thin radiochromic film strips and soft\u2010tissue\u2010simulating plastic (polystyrene) layers gave a means of mapping one\u2010 or two\u2010dimensional profiles of dose distributions adjacent to the high\u2010density shielding materials using a spectrophotometer equipped with a gel scanner or a scanning laser\u2010beam microdensitometer.

An example of a successful formulation is a mixture of 90% by weight Ag\u2013Cu alloy powder in a vinyl polysiloxane resin.

Accordingly, acceptance testing and quality control of CT scanners is of great importance. While most procedures and phantoms for testing are widely accepted, there is still discussion and uncertainty about low\u2010contrast (LC) sensitivity. In our opinion this unsatisfactory situation is caused at least in part by the lack of suitable phantoms for LC resolution measurements. We investigated the commonly used phantoms for LC detectability, the Catphan, and for LC resolution, the ATS phantom. While the Catphan showed stable object contrasts, the ATS phantom's measured contrast exhibited a strong dependence on temperature and x\u2010ray quality. Based on newly developed polyurethane resin materials, we designed and tested a LC resolution phantom with several different contrast steps. The object contrasts showed no dependence on temperature and beam quality. The new LC resolution phantom proved to be very suitable for measuring a scanner's low\u2010contrast sensitivity in the image plane, one of the most important image quality parameters. To assess LC resolution in three dimensions we designed an additional phantom with rows of spherical objects. A first prototype was evaluated in a multicenter study. The setup proved to be very helpful to quantify the in\u2010plane and axial LC sensitivity of spiral CT scan modes.</jats:p>",

Small fiber\u2010shaped dosimeters with dimensions (diameter/length) on the order of 500 \u03bcm/5 mm are attached to one end of an optical fiber, resulting in fiber probes with diameters of less than 1 mm and lengths of up to 15 m. The opposite end of the fiber is connected to an OSL reader that contains a stimulation light source (laser) and a photomultiplier tube that is used for luminescence detection. During irradiation, an optomechanical shutter periodically allows laser light to be transmitted down the optical fiber, to stimulate the luminescence response from the dosimeter being irradiated at a remote location. The luminescence measured during each interval of laser stimulation is indicative of the radiation dose absorbed in the dosimeter since the previous stimulation. The integral absorbed dose is obtained via a summation procedure from the measured dose fractions. Several operating procedures and data processing algorithms were developed in order to increase the speed and accuracy of the measurements, and integrated into the software that controls automated operation of the OSL readers. Periodic modulation of the stimulation also allows the OSL signal to be discriminated from background fluorescence, and thus yields measurements that are unaffected by \u010cerenkov light (the so\u2010called \u201cstem effect\u201d).

        "abstract": "<jats:p>The accuracy with which Monte Carlo models of photon beams generated by linear accelerators (linacs) can describe small\u2010field dose distributions depends on the modeled width of the electron beam profile incident on the linac target. It is known that the electron focal spot width affects penumbra and cross\u2010field profiles; here, the authors explore the extent to which source occlusion reduces linac output for smaller fields and larger spot sizes. A BEAMnrc Monte Carlo linac model has been used to investigate the variation in penumbra widths and small\u2010field output factors with electron spot size. A formalism is developed separating head scatter factors into source occlusion and flattening filter factors. Differences between head scatter factors defined in terms of in\u2010air energy fluence, collision kerma, and terma are explored using Monte Carlo calculations. Estimates of changes in kerma\u2010based source occlusion and flattening filter factors with field size and focal spot width are obtained by calculating doses deposited in a narrow 2 mm wide virtual \u201cmilliphantom\u201d geometry. The impact of focal spot size on phantom scatter is also explored. Modeled electron spot sizes of 0.4\u20130.7 mm FWHM generate acceptable matches to measured penumbra widths. However the 0.5 cm field output factor is quite sensitive to electron spot width, the measured output only being matched by calculations for a 0.7 mm spot width. Because the spectra of the unscattered primary <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2866-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2866:mp2866-math-0001\" /> and head\u2010scattered <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2866-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2866:mp2866-math-0002\" /> photon energy fluences differ, miniphantom\u2010based collision kerma measurements do not scale precisely with total in\u2010air energy fluence <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2866-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2866:mp2866-math-0003\" /> but with <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2866-math-0004.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2866:mp2866-math-0004\" />. For most field sizes, on\u2010axis collision kerma is independent of the focal spot size; but for a 0.5 cm field size and 1.0 mm spot width, it is reduced by around 7% mostly due to source occlusion. The phantom scatter factor of the 0.5 cm field also shows some spot size dependence, decreasing by 6% (relative) as spot size is increased from 0.1 to 1.0 mm. The dependence of small\u2010field source occlusion and output factors on the focal spot size makes this a significant factor in Monte Carlo modeling of small <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2866-math-0005.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2866:mp2866-math-0005\" /> fields. Changes in penumbra width with spot size are not sufficiently large to accurately pinpoint spot widths. Consequently, while Monte Carlo models based exclusively on large\u2010field data can quite accurately predict small\u2010field profiles and PDDs, in the absence of experimental methods of determining incident electron beam profiles it will remain necessary to measure small\u2010field output factors, fine\u2010tuning modeled spot sizes to ensure good matching between the Monte Carlo and the measured output factors.</jats:p>",

An energy minimizing active contour model is then used to classify adipose tissue voxels by including gradient flow and region\u2010based features. Finally, blood vessels are separated from fibroglandular tissue by a k\u2010means clustering algorithm based on automatically extracted shape\u2010based features. To evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, two sets of 15 different patient breast <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CT</jats:styled-content> scans, each acquired with different breast <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CT</jats:styled-content> systems and acquisition settings were obtained. Three slices from each scan were manually segmented under the supervision of an experienced breast radiologist and considered the gold standard. Comparisons with manual segmentation were quantified using five similarity metrics: Dice similarity coefficient (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DSC</jats:styled-content>), sensitivity, conformity coefficient, and two Hausdorff distance measures. To evaluate the robustness to image noise, the segmentation was repeated after separately adding Gaussian noise with increasing standard deviation (in four steps, from 0.01 to 0.04) to an additional 15 slices from the first dataset.

A difference of 49% was found between the response with the axis beam parallel to the film surface (90\u00b0) and with the axis beam perpendicular (0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0).

The many imaging options that are now available for imaging dense breasts show great promise, but there is still the question of determining which women are \u201cdense\u201d and what imaging modality is suitable for individual women. To date, mammographic breast density has been classified according to the Breast Imaging\u2010Reporting and Data System (BI\u2010RADS) categories from visual assessment, but this is known to be very subjective. Despite many research reports, the authors believe there has been a lack of physics\u2010led and evidence\u2010based arguments about what breast density actually is, how it should be measured, and how it should be used. In this paper, the authors attempt to start correcting this situation by reviewing the history of breast density research and the debates generated by the advocacy movement. The authors review the development of breast density estimation from pattern analysis to area\u2010based analysis, and the current automated volumetric breast density (VBD) analysis. This is followed by a discussion on seeking the ground truth of VBD and mapping volumetric methods to BI\u2010RADS density categories. The authors expect great improvement in VBD measurements that will satisfy the needs of radiologists, epidemiologists, surgeons, and physicists. The authors believe that they are now witnessing a paradigm shift toward personalized breast screening, which is going to see many more cancers being detected early, with the use of automated density measurement tools as an important component.</jats:p>",

Here the buildup curve is essentially field size independent. These results clearly show that electrons are the primary cause of dose increase with field size in the buildup region, in contrast to a recent publication claiming that scattered photons are the cause. Further measurements were made by blocking out the primary beam at the level of the jaws and measuring the depth dose of the scattered electrons originating from the jaws.

However, LDCT always suffers from complex noise in reconstructed images. Although deep learning\u2010based methods have shown their strong performance in LDCT denoising, most of them require a large number of paired training data of normal\u2010dose CT (NDCT) images and LDCT images, which are hard to acquire in the clinic. Lack of paired training data significantly undermines the practicability of supervised deep learning\u2010based methods. To alleviate this problem, unsupervised or weakly supervised deep learning\u2010based methods are\u00a0required.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Purpose</jats:title><jats:p>We aimed to propose a method that achieves LDCT denoising without training pairs.

Concretely, LDCT and normal\u2010dose images were fed into one shared flow\u2010based model and projected to the latent space. Then, the degradation between low\u2010dose and normal\u2010dose images was modeled in the latent space. Finally, the model was trained by minimizing the negative log\u2010likelihood loss with no requirement of paired training data. After training, an NDCT image can be input to the trained flow\u2010based model to generate the corresponding LDCT image. The simulated image pairs of NDCT and LDCT can be further used to train supervised denoising neural networks for\u00a0test.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>Our method achieved much better performance on LDCT image simulation compared with the most widely used image\u2010to\u2010image translation method, CycleGAN, according to the radial noise power spectrum. The simulated image pairs could be used for any supervised LDCT denoising neural networks. We validated the effectiveness of our generated image pairs on a classic convolutional neural network, REDCNN, and a novel transformer\u2010based model, TransCT. Our method achieved mean peak signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio (PSNR) of 24.43dB, mean structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.785 on an abdomen CT dataset, mean PSNR of 33.88dB, mean SSIM of 0.797 on a chest CT dataset, which outperformed several traditional CT denoising methods, the same network trained by CycleGAN\u2010generated data, and a novel transfer learning method.

Our purpose in this study was to develop a computerized method for correctly identifying either PA or lateral views of chest radiographs. Our approach is to examine the similarity of a chest image with templates that represent the average chest images of the PA or lateral view for various types of patients. By use of a template matching technique with nine template images for patients of different size in two steps, correlation values were obtained for determining whether a chest image is either a PA or a lateral view. The templates for PA and lateral views were prepared from 447 PA and 200 lateral chest images. For a validation test, this scheme was applied to 1,000 test images consisting of 500 PA and 500 lateral chest radiographs, which are different from training cases. In the first step, 924 (92.4%) of the cases were correctly identified by comparison of the correlation values obtained with the three templates for medium\u2010size patients. In the second step, the correlation values with the six templates for small and large patients were compared, and all of the remaining unidentifiable cases were identified correctly.</jats:p>",

A 5 mm thick lead sheet was positioned at various depths below the surface. The surface dose ratio was calculated by comparison with the surface dose with no lead sheet present. A Monte Carlo model of the x\u2010ray beam and the phantom was generated using the EGSnrcMP code (V4.2). The initial energy spectrum was determined using an empirical method and verified by calculation of depth dose data. The dose was scored in a 1 mm thick slab at the phantom surface. The change in surface dose was calculated as a function of depth to the lead and compared to measured data. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The reduction in surface dose was a function of x\u2010ray beam energy, beam area and the depth of water to the lead. As the depth of water to the lead sheet decreased, there was a reduction in the surface dose. With the 8 cm diameter applicator and 1 cm depth of water to the lead, the surface dose ratio was 0.918 for the 75 kVp x\u2010ray beam and 0.890 for the 100 kVp x\u2010ray beam. For the smaller applicators, there was less reduction in the surface dose ratios. Surface dose ratios calculated by the EGSnrcMP code were in good agreement with measured data, with a maximum deviation of 1.2%. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The surface dose for kilovoltage x\u2010ray beams is reduced when lead is underlying in the phantom.

Traditionally this has been done by using methods mainly based on empirical factors which, at least to some extent, try to separate the influence from input parameters such as field size, depth, distance, etc. The growing complexity of modern treatment techniques does however make this approach increasingly difficult, both in terms of practical application and in terms of the reliability of the results. In the present work the performance of a model\u2010based approach, describing the influence from different input parameters through actual modeling of the physical effects, has been investigated in detail. The investigated model is based on two components related to megavoltage photon beams; one describing the exiting energy fluence per delivered MU, and a second component describing the dose deposition through a pencil kernel algorithm solely based on a measured beam quality index. Together with the output calculations, the basis of a method aiming to predict the inherent calculation uncertainties in individual treatment setups has been developed. This has all emerged from the intention of creating a clinical dose/MU verification tool that requires an absolute minimum of commissioned input data. This evaluation was focused on irregular field shapes and performed through comparison with output factors measured at 5, 10, and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7316-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp7316:mp7316-math-0001\" /> depth in ten multileaf collimated fields on four different linear accelerators with varying multileaf collimator designs.

As tumor movement of up to 5 cm has been reported by several investigators, accurate investigation of the internal margin (IM) to 3D CTV is necessary. The purpose of this study was to compare the differences in volume between PTVs generated using 4D\u2010CT (4D PTV) and 3D\u2010CT (3D PTV) for varying degrees of tumor motion and to evaluate the differences in dose to normal lung and spinal cord. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> A movable phantom was used to simulate lung movement (Figure 1). Three blocks of rubber were attached to the phantom and a 3D\u2010CT and a 4D\u2010CT were taken. Then, PTVs were delineated and compared. After that, the PTVs were transferred to a Rando phantom for dose analysis. Also, investigation of varying displacements of lung tumor was done using four blocks of rubber attached to a movable phantom with different known displacements (Figure 2). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The average reduction in PTV volumes using 4D\u2010CT was 33.8%. This led to average decreases of 19.2%, 20.1% and 33.8% for lung V20, mean lung dose and maximum spinal cord dose, respectively (Table 1)., Investigation of varying displacements of lung tumor shows that if tumors move more than 4 cm, the 4D PTV may be equal to or larger than the 3D PTV(Table 2).Figures 3 shows overlapping of PTVs of tumors with 2 cm motion and 4 cm motion in 3D and 4D. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> It can be concluded that 4D\u2010CT reduces organ at risk doses. For lung tumors with large displacements, 4D\u2010CT is a promising method because the exact IM in the direction of tumor motion is achieved. In these cases, the use of 3D causes not only unnecessary dose to normal tissue but also missing part of the tumor (Figure 3).</jats:p>",

The Jensen Renyi (JR) divergence is a non\u2010parametric generalized statistical measure that can be applied as an energy function for all three of these objectives. Further efficiency and accuracy can be attained by coupling the objective functions such that they iteratively reinforce one another. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> The JR divergence was used as an energy function and with a finite difference scheme, the level set differential equation was solved for an active contour along with the energy gradient of control points placed using an adaptive mesh. The segmentation portion has been validated using three data sets; PET and CBCT images of an in\u2010house phantom for various image qualities, 7 PET scans of head and neck cases from the Louvain database and 22 PET/CT scans of patients with non\u2010small cell lung carcinoma from the MAASTRO database. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Segmentation of an in\u2010house phantom using the JR divergence showed a marked improvement in concordance index (CI) by almost a factor of 2 compared to the mutual information metric below SNR values of 35.3 and 24.0 for the CBCT and PET images. Average CI for the 7 Louvain cases was found to be 0.56. An average error in estimating the maximal tumor diameters of the 22 MAASTRO cases was found to be 63%, 19.5% and 14% using CT, PET and combined PET/ CT modalities. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The JR divergence metric was applied to the task of segmentation using a level sets active contour. It was found to provide improved noise tolerance and competitive segmentation accuracy compared to 9 other PET segmentation methods. A coupled segmentation/registration scheme has been implemented using the JR divergence. Validation is currently being performed using plasticized pig lungs.

Most commercial treatment planning systems do not include collision prevention simulation step. On the other hand, a fool\u2010proof collision\u2010map, lookup table, and simpler analytical method guard only against the most apparent collisions. Thus, a comprehensive virtual simulator design for collision avoidance is very useful for external radiotherapy planning. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> An accurate modeling of the treatment accelerator is possible with geometric data. Three\u2010dimensional patient modeling is also possible from the patient's CT data. Since each component in the data bank is described as an independent mesh modeling based on the type of associated polygons, relative position changes can be described easily for the device dynamics simulation. The relative motions of the gantry and the treatment table are collected from the treatment plan and the graphical user interface generates the events at the given time intervals. This visual system is incorporated with the treatment planning simulation system. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The quality verification of our virtual simulator for the potential collision has been performed with two combinations of treatment table and gantry rotations where a collision is eminent based on the visual assessment. The planner can search for beam paths with minimal critical structure interference before extensive optimization process. A database of CT and MR scans for all tumor sites is being built, which provide useful information to map all potential collision possibilities for all treatment isocenters. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The important benefits of this virtual simulator is the replacement of the conventional laborious procedures required for the expensive hardware simulator unit, the efficiency increment, the accuracy improvement of radiation treatment procedure, and the cost reduction in terms of time and physical patient's presence.</jats:p>",

The phantom, in the size of 30\u00d712\u00d730 cm3, was made from slabs of water\u2010equivalent materials for low energy x\u2010rays, PW\u2010LR (CIRS, Norfolk, VA). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The field size of x\u2010rays from each tube is 20\u00d720 cm2 at the isocenter. Small differences of 5\u201310 % in measured radiation dose at the isocenter between two x\u2010ray tubes were observed. The doses measured in the phantom at a depth of 1 cm from the treatment table were 0.05 cGy, 0.16 cGy, and 0.19 cGy resulting from a pair of obliquely beams of Cranium\u2010heavy, Thorax\u2010Heavy and Abdomen\u2010Heavy clinical protocols respectively. It was found that there was up to 77% dose reduction by selecting Abdomen\u2010Light instead of Abdomen\u2010Heavy acquisition protocols. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Although the imaging doses to patients resulting from a single pair of beams are low, the sum of multiple acquisitions (10\u201020 pairs) is still significant, which can be common for one treatment fraction if non\u2010coplanar beams are used. The imaging doses strongly depend on the image acquisition protocols. During treatment, the low dose protocols should be chosen, given that image quality is not compromised.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>State\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithms often define the filtering operation to be performed along oblique filtering lines in the detector. A limited scan field of view leads to the truncation of those filtering lines, which causes artifacts in the final reconstructed volume. In contrast to the case where filtering is performed solely along the detector rows, no methods are available for the case of oblique filtering lines. In this work, the authors present two novel truncation correction methods which effectively handle data truncation in this case. Method 1 (basic approach) handles data truncation in two successive preprocessing steps by applying a hybrid data extrapolation method, which is a combination of a water cylinder extrapolation and a Gaussian extrapolation. It is independent of any specific reconstruction algorithm. Method 2 (kink approach) uses similar concepts for data extrapolation as the basic approach but needs to be integrated into the reconstruction algorithm. Experiments are presented from simulated data of the FORBILD head phantom, acquired along a partial\u2010circle\u2010plus\u2010arc trajectory. The theoretically exact M\u2010line algorithm is used for reconstruction. Although the discussion is focused on theoretically exact algorithms, the proposed truncation correction methods can be applied to any FBP algorithm that exposes oblique filtering lines.</jats:p>",

An image containing a series of test patterns is generated in a direct and integrated fashion. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Two MLC star patterns, a cone pattern and the laser lines are recorded on the same imaging medium, enabling 0.1 mm accuracy measurements. Phosphor plates are used as the imaging medium due to their unique property that the red light of wall laser erases the radiation information stored on phosphor plates.

The prescription dose is 80Gy for 40 treatment fractions. The dose distributions were recalculated with consideration of the intrafractional motion and the localization error. The statistical uncertainties of the intrafractional motion and the localization error were derived based on the motion tracking data recorded by the Calypso 4D localization system for a large patient population. The TCP and NTCP were calculated based on the dose volume histograms (DVH) of prostate and rectum for plans with different margins using an equivalent uniform dose (EUD) based biological model.

When the posterior treatment margin was reduced from 5mm to zero, the EUD of prostate decreased from 83Gy (\u00b10.5Gy) to 81Gy (\u00b10.5Gy) and the TCP dropped from 93.2% (\u00b10.1%) to 91.7% (\u00b10.1%), the EUD of the rectum decreased more significantly from 48.9Gy (\u00b10.4Gy) to 32.5Gy (\u00b10.5Gy) and the NTCP dropped from 13.3% (\u00b11.5%) to 0.03% (\u00b1 0.01%). <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The treatment margin size affects the dose to the target and the nearby critical structure.

All structures were contoured by a single physician at the time of treatment. Each plan was imported into a customizable treatment plan analysis suite (CERR). Using CERR, pre\u2010fraction isocenter verification CT scans were fused with the original treatment plan using the external body frame as a reference. The original planned dose distribution was then translated from original treatment plan isocenter to pre\u2010fraction verification isocenters in each fraction. Dose and volume parameters for pertinent structures were automatically extracted using both registration methods (planned or pre\u2010fraction scans) for the original treatment plan and for all subsequent fractions.

Ideally, the beams would represent the anticipated stray radiation encountered during clinical use. However, it is impractical to expect a medical physicist to possess the equipment necessary to accurately measure transmission of scattered radiation.

Based on the observed range of beam qualities, five representative clinical primary beam qualities, specified by kV and added filtration, were selected for this evaluation. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using these primary beams as source definitions to generate scattered spectra from the clinical primary beams. Using numerical optimization, ideal scatter mimicking primary beams, specified by kV and added aluminum filtration, were matched to the scattered spectra according to half\u2010 and quarter\u2010value layers and spectral shape. To within reasonable approximation, these theoretical scatter\u2010mimicking primary beams were reproduced experimentally in laboratory x ray beams and used to measure transmission through pure lead and protective garments. For this proof of concept, the DRIP for pure lead and the garments was calculated by assigning equal weighting to percent transmission measurements for each of the five beams. Finally, the areal density of lead and garments was measured for consideration alongside the DRIP to assess the protective value of each material for a given weight.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results:</jats:title><jats:p>The authors identified ideal scatter mimicking primary beams that matched scattered spectra to within 0.01 mm for half\u2010 and quarter\u2010value layers in copper and within 5% for the shape function. The corresponding experimental scatter\u2010mimicking primary beams matched the Monte Carlo generated scattered spectra with maximum deviations of 6.8% and 6.6% for half\u2010 and quarter\u2010value layers. The measured DRIP for 0.50 mm lead sheet was 2.0, indicating that it transmitted, on average, 2% of incident radiation. The measured DRIP for a lead garment and one lead\u2010alternative garment closely matched that for pure lead of 0.50 mm thickness. The DRIP for other garments was substantially higher than 0.50 mm lead (3.9\u20135.4), indicating they transmitted about twice as much radiation.

Radiation therapy was delivered by means of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) combined with HDR brachytherapy.Eclipse v8.6 TPS (Varian Medical Systems, USA) was used for treatment planning.In the diagnostic radiology suite, a flexible guide wire was passed through the biliary stent to a point past the stenosis. Subsequently catheter localisation, dummy wire was inserted and orthogonal films were used to confirm the position. All the patients were scanned on CT scanner (Siemens, Germany) with a slice thickness of 3 mm without any radio opaque dummy. The GTV, CTV OAR were contoured according to ICRU 62.Since the catheter is inserted in biliary stent, the applicator reconstruction is not possible. The first source point was reconstructed from the tip of the stent. From the orthogonal topograph the offset was calculated by measuring the tip of the stent to first dummy source distance. This offset was set in the planning. With the optimum source length the dose was calculated and CTV, OAR doses were quantified. The External and brachytherapy plans were summed to produce resultant DVH. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The applicator reconstruction accuracy was found to be within \u00b12mm.

The existing MRC uses tungsten rods, while the new MLC will use steel as the leaf material. In the current study the attenuation and activation characteristics of steel are compared with those of tungsten to ensure that (a) the attenuation achieved in the MLC is at least equivalent to that of the existing MRC, and (b) that the activation of the steel will not result in a significant change in the activation levels within the treatment room. The latter point is important since personnel exposure (particularly to the radiation therapy technologists) from induced radioactivity must be minimized. Measurement of the neutron beam attenuation in a broad beam geometry showed that a 30 cm thick steel leaf yielded 2.5% transmission. This compared favorably with the 4% transmission obtained with the existing MRC. Irradiation of steel and tungsten samples at different depths in a 30 cm steel block indicated that the activation of steel should be no worse than that of tungsten.</jats:p>",

By using such magnetic fields the dose delivered to the tumor region can increase significantly relative to that deposited to the healthy tissue. Initially we calculated the magnetic fields produced by the Helmholtz coil and modified Helmholtz coil configurations. These configurations, which can readily be used to generate high intensity magnetic fields, approximate the idealized magnetic fields studied in our previous publications. It was therefore of interest to perform a detailed study of the fields produced by these configurations. Electron beam dose distributions for 15 MeV electrons were calculated using the ACCEPTM code for a 3T transverse magnetic field produced by the modified Helmholtz configuration. The dose distribution was compared to those obtained with no magnetic field. The results were similar to those obtained in our previous work, where an idealized step function magnetic field was used and a 3T field was shown to be the optimal field strength. A simpler configuration was also studied in which a single external coil was used to generate the field. Electron dose distributions are also presented for a given geometry and given magnetic field strength using this configuration. The results indicate that this method is more difficult to apply to radiotherapy due to its lack of symmetry and its irregularity. For the various configurations dealt with here, a major problem is the need to shield the magnetic field in the beam propagation volume, a topic that must be studied in detail.</jats:p>",

Dynamic delivery techniques were introduced to overcome these problems. This study is to compare the dosimetric performance of dynamic tomotherapy delivery (5.0cm jaw running\u2010start\u2010stop (RSS)) with fixed jaw HT and VMAT deliveries. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Sixteen patient cases, including brain, head&amp;neck (HN), lung and prostate, were selected and de\u2010identified prior to treatment planning. VMAT plans were generated using Varian RapidArc\u2122 (RA) (one or two arcs) and HT plans using TomoTherapy\u00ae (fixed 2.5cm jaw). The tomotherapy RSS plans were generated using tomotherapy's research engine and optimized based on 5.0cm dynamic jaw, which allows larger jaw opening for lower dose gradient and smaller jaw opening at the target border when sharp penumbra is required. All 16 cases were planned based on identical contours, prescriptions, and planning objectives. Dose indices for targets and critical organs were compared based on dose\u2010volume histograms, delivery time, and monitor units. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The average delivery time was reduced from 4.8min (HT) to 2.92min (RSS). RSS showed comparable target dose homogeneity to HT. Three delivery techniques showed comparable normal tissue sparing for lung cases, with improved sparing of cord with RSS. For prostate cases, RSS showed improved bladder and rectum doses compared to HT due to better longitudinal sparing. Superior normal tissue sparing was observed in RSS plans for optical nerves in brain cases and larynx or parotids for HN cases. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Tomotherapy RSS with 5.0cm dynamic jaw is overall comparable, if not better, to 2.5cm fixed jaw HT, with faster treatment delivery.

One popular device is the NOMOS MIMiC Collimator coupled to the <jats:sc>CORVUS</jats:sc> treatment planning system. The MIMiC collimator, mounted on a linac head, opens and closes one or more of its 40 small leaves as determined by the planner while the linac delivers radiation and the gantry rotates. This dynamic IMRT allows the intensity to be modulated yielding a highly conformal dose distribution. However, the dose output becomes a function of the detailed manner in which the leaves open and close, since the opening and closing are not instantaneous. We investigate the effect of switch rates and delay in the open/close events on the output profiles. The output is enhanced as the switch rate increases. The enhancement factor at any point of measurement is dependent on its distance from the central plane. We interpret these variations in terms of a simple model, which includes the effect of leaf travel time during the process of opening and closing. We also include the time delay in establishing the specified pressure in the pneumonic device, which controls the opening and closing of the leaves. The information presented here offers a means for incorporating these output changes into the planning system. This may avoid the current situation where many patient plans need to be renormalized based on the actual measurement taken during the delivery of the specified intensity pattern to a phantom.</jats:p>",

This high dose region and sharp distal fall off that produces no primary particle exit dose can be placed at any point within the patient leading to the use of fewer beams and lower integral doses. Proton patient immobilization needs to reduce patient motion to the largest extent feasible, as is the case with other radiation therapy modalities, but also needs to consider the effect of the immobilization device on the proton range and whether this is accurately reflected in the dose calculation. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Our proton treatment center has treated patients with protons for over 20 years, and the development of effective immobilization methods has been an integral part of this experience. For the various anatomic sites, specific devices have been developed that position and immobilize the patient reproducibly and effectively.

The WET of each immobilization material has been well characterized and incorporated in the (CT\u2010based) proton range calculation to minimize systematic errors in the proton range uncertainty. In our experience, proton immobilization devices should have beveled edges when possible to avoid edge effects that can drastically affect the depth of proton penetration.

A new technique for velocity measurement is presented based upon the ratio of the temporal derivative to the spatial derivative of the contrast bolus in the direction of flow. With the addition of a small correction factor, the value obtained is shown to reflect the transport velocity, or the velocity at which the contrast is transported down the vessel of interest. Most blood flow measurements based on bolus tracking techniques are actually using the contrast transport velocity to represent the blood flow velocity. Because of the streaming that occurs due to laminary flow conditions, the measured transport velocity is found to be somewhere between the average and the peak (central) fluid velocities for measurements taken during the traversal of the bolus leading edge. The spatial and temporal variation of the transport velocity are found to be consistent with the bolus motion expected in the presence of laminar flow. From x\u2010ray images of contrast passage through simple tubes, we find that the derivative method measures the transport velocity during passage of the bolus leading edge. In most cases of laminar blood flow, the leading edge transport velocity can be 20%\u201340% higher than the average blood velocity.</jats:p>",

With this arrangement two\u2010dimensional scans of the thermal neutrons could be performed quickly and with high accuracy.</jats:p>",

Measured depth doses out of the field, for different field sizes and various distances from the beam edge were compared with the corresponding AAA and Acuros\u2010XB calculations in water. Four volumetric modulated arc therapy plans (in the RapidArc form) were optimized in a water equivalent phantom, PTW Octavius, to obtain a region always shielded by the MLC (or MLC and jaw) during the delivery. Doses to different points located in the shielded region and in a target\u2010like structure were measured with an ion chamber, and results were compared with the AAA and Acuros\u2010XB calculations.

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Segmentation of three\u2010dimensional rotational angiography (3D\u2010RA) can provide quantitative 3D morphological information of vasculature. The expectation maximization\u2010(EM\u2010) based segmentation techniques have been widely used in the medical image processing community, because of the implementation simplicity, and computational efficiency of the approach. In a brain 3D\u2010RA, vascular regions usually occupy a very small proportion (around 1%) inside an entire image volume. This severe imbalance between the intensity distributions of vessels and background can lead to inaccurate statistical modeling in the EM\u2010based segmentation methods, and thus adversely affect the segmentation quality for 3D\u2010RA. In this paper we present a new method for the extraction of vasculature in 3D\u2010RA images. The new method is fully automatic and computationally efficient. As compared with the original 3D\u2010RA volume, there is a larger proportion (around 20%) of vessels in its corresponding maximum intensity projection (MIP) image. The proposed method exploits this property to increase the accuracy of statistical modeling with the EM algorithm. The algorithm takes an iterative approach to compiling the 3D vascular segmentation progressively with the segmentation of MIP images along the three principal axes, and use a winner\u2010takes\u2010all strategy to combine the results obtained along individual axes. Experimental results on 12 3D\u2010RA clinical datasets indicate that the segmentations obtained by the new method exhibit a high degree of agreement to the ground truth segmentations and are comparable to those produced by the manual optimal global thresholding method.</jats:p>",
