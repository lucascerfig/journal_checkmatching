Patients received HFRT to a total dose of 66 Gy in 22 fractions (3 Gy/fraction) delivered via volume modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in 2011\u20132016. Treatment effectiveness was measured by the biochemical failure-free survival rate. Toxicity was assessed according to the criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and quality of life according to the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). In this regard, quality of life (QoL) was measured longitudinally, at a median of 2 and 5 years after RT. Enrolled patients had low-risk (40.2%), intermediate-risk (47.5%), and high-risk (12.3%) PCa. Median follow-up was 75 months. The biochemical failure-free survival rate was 94.2%. The incidence of acute grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity was 9.84% and 28.69%, respectively. The incidence rate of late grade 2 or higher GI and GU toxicity was 1.64% and 4.10%, respectively. Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) scores showed that the majority of patients maintained their QoL. HFRT to 66 Gy with VMAT was associated with adequate biochemical control, low toxicity and good reported GU and GI quality of life.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Biological rhythms are important regulators of immune functions. In intensive care unit (ICU), sepsis is known to be associated with rhythm disruption. Our objectives were to determine factors associated with rhythm disruption of the body temperature and to assess the relationship between temperature and mortality in septic shock patients; In a cohort of septic shock, we recorded body temperature over a 24-h period on day 2 after ICU admission. For each patient, the temperature rhythmicity was assessed by defining period and amplitude, and the adjusted average (mesor) of the temperature by sinusoidal regression and cosinor analysis. Analyses were performed to assess factors associated with the three temperature parameters (period, amplitude, and mesor) and mortality. 162 septic shocks were enrolled. The multivariate analysis demonstrates that the period of temperature was associated with gender (women, coefficient \u22122.2 h, p = 0.031) and acetaminophen use (coefficient \u22124.3 h, p = 0.002). The mesor was associated with SOFA score (coefficient \u22120.05 \u00b0C per SOFA point, p = 0.046), procalcitonin (coefficient 0.001 \u00b0C per ng/mL, p = 0.005), and hydrocortisone use (coefficient \u22120.5 \u00b0C, p = 0.002). The amplitude was associated with the dialysis (coefficient \u22120.5 \u00b0C, p = 0.002). Mortality at day 28 was associated with lower mesor (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.90; p = 0.02), and higher amplitude (adjusted hazard ratio 5.48, 95% CI 1.66 to 18.12; p = 0.005) of temperature. Many factors, such as therapeutics, influence the body temperature during septic shock. Lower mesor and higher amplitude were associated with mortality and could be considered prognostic markers in ICU. In the age of artificial intelligence, the incorporation of such data in an automated scoring alert could compete with physicians to identify high-risk patients during septic shock.</jats:p>",

Based on an in silico model of the tilapia NKB receptor Tachykinin 3 receptor a (tiTac3Ra) found in the current study, we determined the key residues involved in binding to tilapia NKB and its functional homologue NKF (Neurokinin F). Despite studies in humans suggesting the crucial role of F2516.44 and M2897.43 in NKB binding, no direct peptide interaction was observed in tilapia homologs. In-silico, Ala mutations on residues F2516.44 and M2897.43 did not influence binding affinity, but significantly affected the stability of tiTac3Ra. Moreover, in vitro studies indicated them to be critical to tiNKB/tiNKF-induced receptor activity. The binding of NKB antagonists to tiTac3Ra both in-vitro and in vivo inhibits FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) release and sperm production in mature tilapia males. Non-peptide NKB antagonist SB-222200 had a strong inhibitory effect on the Tac3Ra activation. SB-222200 also decreased LH plasma levels; two hours post intraperitoneal injection, changed sperm volume and the ratios of the different stages along the spermatogenesis in tilapia testes.</jats:p>",

Inflammatory response was significantly delayed and of lower intensity in the old rats. Myofibroblastic response, representing the proliferative stage, was delayed and of lower intensity in the old rats, albeit not statistically significant. Reduced initial tissue damage due to decreased and delayed inflammatory response in the old rats ultimately led to faster clinical wound healing compared to the young rats, despite a statistically non-significant lower proliferative response in the old rats.</jats:p>",

Methods: To explore the influence of CIEDI on the outcomes of TLE and the differences between patients with systemic (Sy) vs. local (Lo) CIEDI, we performed a sub-analysis of the EORP ELECTRa (European Lead Extraction ConTRolled) Registry. Results: Among 3555 patients enrolled by 73 centers in 19 Countries, the indication for TLE was CIEDI in 1850: 1170 with Lo-CIEDI and 680 with Sy-CIEDI. Patients with CIEDI had a worse in-hospital prognosis in terms of major complications (3.57% vs. 1.71%; p = 0.0007) and mortality (2.27% vs. 0.49%; p &lt; 0.0001). Sy-CIEDI was an independent predictor of in-hospital death (H.R. 2.14; 95%CI 1.06\u20134.33. p = 0.0345). Patients with Sy-CIEDI more frequently had an initial CIED implant and a higher prevalence of comorbidities, while subjects with Lo-CIEDI had a higher prevalence of previous CIED procedures. Time from signs of CIEDI and TLE was longer for Lo-CIEDI despite a shorter pre-TLE antibiotic treatment. Conclusions: Patients with CIEDI have a worse in-hospital prognosis after TLE, especially for patients with Sy-CIEDI. These results raise the suspicion that in a relevant group of patients CIEDI can be systemic from the beginning without progression from Lo-CIEDI. Future research is needed to characterize this subgroup of patients.</jats:p>",

These ticks occur in a large area characterised by a varied climate type, vegetation, and availability of potential hosts. Hence, they exhibit high ecological plasticity and adaptability to periodically adverse conditions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of D. reticulatus adults to overwinter in the natural habitat. Specimens marked with a permanent oil marker on the festoons were placed in their natural habitats for the winter. Concurrently, tick survival in laboratory conditions at a temperature of 5 \u00b0C and 18 \u00b0C was assessed as a control. The groups were compared with each other by determination of the weight of fat bodies. In the field conditions, 67.9% females and 60.0% males survived the winter. There was no significant difference in the survival of ticks in the laboratory. A significantly lower fat body weight was found in the group of ticks overwintering in the field conditions and exhibiting questing activity between spring and late autumn during the following year. On the population scale, adult D. reticulatus ticks are able to survive the winter in temperate climate conditions at a level ensuring a further increase in their population size. In adverse weather conditions, ticks enter diapause, thus maximally reducing the utilisation of the content of their fat bodies. This facilitates long-term survival in the environment.</jats:p>",

The capability of regeneration varies among organisms and the regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) is limited to specific animals, including the earthworm Perionyx excavatus. Thus, it is crucial to establish P. excavatus as a model system to investigate mechanisms of CNS regeneration. Here, we set up a culture system to sustain the life cycle of P. excavatus and characterize the development of P. excavatus, from embryo to juvenile, based on its morphology, myogenesis and neurogenesis. During development, embryos have EdU-positive proliferating cells throughout the whole body, whereas juveniles maintain proliferating cells exclusively in the head and tail regions, not in the trunk region. Interestingly, juveniles amputated at the trunk, which lacks proliferating cells, are able to regenerate the entire head. In this process, a group of cells, which are fully differentiated, reactivates cell proliferation. Our data suggest that P. excavatus is a model system to study CNS regeneration, which is dependent on the dedifferentiation of cells.</jats:p>",

Here we discuss how obesity in older adults impacts inflammatory, cardiovascular, and neurobiological functions with an emphasis on how exercise mediates each topic. Although obesity is a reversible disorder through lifestyle changes, it is important to note that early interventions are crucial to prevent pathological changes seen in the aging obese population. Lifestyle modifications such as physical activity (including aerobic and resistance training) should be considered as a main intervention to minimize the synergistic effect of obesity on age-related conditions, such as cerebrovascular disease.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>A hallmark of antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) is the production of viral small interfering RNA (vsiRNA). Profiling of vsiRNAs indicates that certain regions of viral RNA genome or transcribed viral RNA, dubbed vsiRNA hotspots, are more prone to RNAi-mediated cleavage for vsiRNA biogenesis. However, the biological relevance of hotspot vsiRNAs to the host innate defence against pathogens remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that direct targeting a hotspot by a synthetic vsiRNA confers host resistance to virus infection. Using Northern blotting and RNAseq, we obtained a profile of vsiRNAs of the African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV), a single-stranded DNA virus. Sense and anti-sense strands of small RNAs corresponding to a hotspot and a coldspot vsiRNA were synthesised. Co-inoculation of Nicotiana benthamiana with the double-stranded hotspot siRNA protected plants from ACMV infection, where viral DNA replication and accumulation of viral mRNA were undetectable. The sense or anti-sense strand of this hotspot vsiRNA, and the coldspot vsiRNA in both double-stranded and single-stranded formats possessed no activity in viral protection. We further demonstrated that the hotspot vsiRNA-mediated virus resistance had a threshold effect and required an active RDR6. These data show that hotspot vsiRNAs bear a functional significance on antiviral RNAi, suggesting that they may have the potential as an exogenous protection agent for controlling destructive viral diseases in plants.</jats:p>",

Although the release of IL-6 from muscle has been extensively studied, the information on the cellular mechanisms is fragmentary and scarce, especially regarding the role of Ca2+ signals. The aim of this study was to characterize the role of the main components of Ca2+ signals in human skeletal muscle cells during IL-6 secretion stimulated by the Ca2+ mobilizing agonist ATP. Primary cultures were prepared from surgical samples, fluorescence microscopy was used to evaluate the Ca2+ signals and the stimulated release of IL-6 into the medium was determined using ELISA. Intracellular calcium chelator Bapta, low extracellular calcium and the Ca2+ channels blocker La3+ reduced the ATP-stimulated, but not the basal secretion. Secretion was inhibited by blockers of L-type (nifedipine, verapamil), T-type (NNC55-0396) and Orai1 (Synta66) Ca2+ channels and by silencing Orai1 expression. The same effect was achieved with inhibitors of ryanodine receptors (ryanodine, dantrolene) and IP3 receptors (xestospongin C, 2-APB, caffeine). Inhibitors of calmodulin (calmidazolium) and calcineurin (FK506) also decreased secretion. IL-6 transcription in response to ATP was not affected by Bapta or by the T channel blocker. Our results prove that ATP-stimulated IL-6 secretion is mediated at the post-transcriptional level by Ca2+ signals, including the mobilization of calcium stores, the activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry, and the subsequent activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels and calmodulin/calcineurin pathways.</jats:p>",

Analyses of sperm motility, membrane integrity, and membrane\u2013acrosome integrity with the ISAS3Fun method were performed. Sperm morphometry of the fluorescence sperm subpopulations obtained with the ISAS3Fun method was also analysed. Significant differences between high- and low-fertility groups were only found with the ISAS3Fun technique, specifically in sperm acrosome integrity, the proportion of spermatozoa with an intact acrosome and damaged membrane, and in sperm head width of spermatozoa with intact structures. Discriminant analyses allowed us to correctly classify 90% of sperm samples in their fertility group using sperm quality parameters. Given that only the results obtained with the ISAS3Fun technique were related to bull fertility, we performed a second experiment aimed to validate the efficacy of this technique to detect the acrosomal integrity of bull spermatozoa, comparing them with the conventional FITC-PNA/propidium iodide (PNA/PI) combination under capacitating conditions. The results indicated that the ISAS3Fun combination provided an accurate assessment of both viability and acrosomal integrity for ejaculated spermatozoa, while the PNA/PI combination underestimated the extension of acrosomal damage due to false negatives. It was concluded that the simultaneous assessment of sperm plasma membranes and acrosome integrity with the ISAS3Fun method is precise and seems to have a greater potential to discriminate between high- and low-fertility bulls than more conventional in vitro sperm quality tests.</jats:p>",

Due to this, it is important to develop in silico tools to facilitate the accurate identification and functional cataloging of gene expression changes associated with SCNVs from pan-cancer data.

However, the diagnostic accuracy of clinical features is unknown. (2) Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of patient-reported clinical manifestations to identify cases of COVID-19. (3) Methodology: Cross-sectional study using data from a national registry in Chile. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed using RT-PCR in all cases. Anonymised information regarding demographic characteristics and clinical features were assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to combine epidemiological risk factors and clinical features. (4) Results: A total of 2,187,962 observations were available for analyses. Male participants had a mean age of 43.1 \u00b1 17.5 years. The most common complaints within the study were headache (39%), myalgia (32.7%), cough (31.6%), and sore throat (25.7%). The most sensitive features of disease were headache, myalgia, and cough, and the most specific were anosmia and dysgeusia/ageusia. A multivariable model showed a fair diagnostic accuracy, with a ROC AUC of 0.744 (95% CI 0.743\u20130.746). (5) Discussion: No single clinical feature was able to fully confirm or exclude an infection by SARS-CoV-2. The combination of several demographic and clinical factors had a fair diagnostic accuracy in identifying patients with the disease. This model can help clinicians tailor the probability of COVID-19 and select diagnostic tests appropriate to their setting.</jats:p>",

This study measures the influence of different antihistamines on the biologic sleep pattern of urticaria patients and the relevance of sleep in urticaria patients. Methods: Ten patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and uncontrolled symptoms under a single dose of second-generation antihistamines were included. Two nights were monitored: the first night after 5 days on single dosage and the second night after 5 days on fourfold dosage. Patient-rated questionnaires were used and sleep was monitored using polygraphy. Results: The patients\u2019 rated daytime sleepiness decreased (p = 0.0319), as did their insomnia severity (p = 0.0349). The urticaria control (UCT) improved (p = 0.0007), as did the quality of life (p &lt; 0.0001). There was no significant change of nightly pruritus (p = 0.1173), but there was an improvement of daytime pruritus (p = 0.0120).

After the administration of Vit D3, the Vit D3 + SEF-treated mice were exposed to SEF treatment by a high-voltage alternating current over five days. Serum biochemical examinations revealed that both the creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations were significantly higher in the Vit D3-treated group. Significantly, decreased Cl concentrations, and increased Ca and inorganic phosphorus concentrations, were found in the Vit D3-treated group. In the Vit D3 + SEF-treated group, these parameters returned to the levels of the untreated group. In the Vit D3-treated group, histopathological examinations showed marked multifocal calcification in the lumens of the renal tubules and the renal parenchyma. The myocardium was replaced by abundant granular mineralization (calcification), with degeneration and necrosis of the calcified fibers. The stomach showed calcification of the cardiac mucosa. SEF treatment remarkably attenuated the Vit D3-induced hypervitaminotic injuries. In conclusion, this study provides important evidence that SEF treatment can reduce hypercalcemia and remove calcium deposits from the renal, cardiac, and gastric tissues. SEF treatment is useful in the regulation of disorders caused by an imbalance of serum electrolytes.</jats:p>",

After 7 or 14 days, stem cell marker genes, as well as endothelial, osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic genes, are analyzed by qPCR. Free calcium and phosphate ion concentrations are assessed in the cell culture supernatant. After one week and 5 \u00b5g/mL aCaP, downregulation of osteogenic markers ALP and Runx2 is found, and averaged across the three donors. Our results show that after two weeks, ALP is further downregulated, but Runx2 is upregulated. Endothelial cell marker genes, such as CD31 and CD34, are upregulated with 50 \u00b5g/mL aCaP and a 2-week exposure. Inter-donor variability is high: Two out of three donors show a significant upregulation of ALP and Runx2 at day 14 with 50 \u00b5g/mL aCaP compared to 5 \u00b5g/mL aCaP. Notably, all changes in stem cell commitment are obtained in the absence of an osteogenic medium. While the chemical composition of the culture medium and the saturation status towards calcium phosphate phases remain approximately the same for all conditions, gene expression of ASCs changes considerably.

An effective treatment that directly targets cancer-induced wasting is desperately needed to improve the quality of life and the survival of cancer patients. Recently, an antibiotic SFX was shown to have anti-tumour and anti-metastatic effects in mouse models of breast cancer. Hence, in this study, we examined the efficacy of SFX in the treatment of cancer-induced cachexia. C26 cachexic mice models were administered with SFX, and the tumour volume and body weight were regularly measured. Blood glucose, skeletal muscles, and adipose tissue were examined at the endpoint. Contrary to a previous study, SFX did not reduce the tumour volume in mice bearing C26 cells. Administration of SFX neither revealed any survival benefit nor rescued C26 cachectic mice from muscle wasting. Interestingly, SFX administration partially rescued (~10%) tumour-induced weight loss by preserving both the subcutaneous and intestinal fat mass. Together, these results suggest that the administration of SFX could partially rescue cancer-induced weight loss by inhibiting lipolysis. As anti-cachexia therapies are scarce, the results could facilitate the design of combinatorial therapies involving SFX, standard-of-care chemotherapeutics, and drugs that inhibit muscle atrophy for the treatment of cancer cachexia.</jats:p>",

Zipper is a myosin II\u2019s actin-binding heavy chain; hence, it is important for contracting actin, cell proliferation, and cell sheet adhesion for branching of the tracheal system in post-larval development of the D. melanogaster. Nevertheless, the specific role of Zipper in the larva is still in question. This paper intended to investigate the specific role of Zipper in branching morphogenesis and lumenogenesis in early developmental stages. It did so by checking the localization of the protein in the cytoplasm of the terminal cells and also by analyzing the morphology of zipper RNAi loss-of-function mutants in regard to branching and lumen formation in the terminal cells. A rescue experiment of RNAi mutants was also performed to check the sufficiency of Zipper in branching morphogenesis. Confocal imaging showed the localization of Zipper in the cytoplasm of the terminal cells, and respective quantitative analyses demonstrated that zipper RNAi terminal cells develop significantly fewer branches. Such a result hinted that Zipper is required for the regulation of branching in the terminal cells of D. melanogaster. Nevertheless, Zipper is not significantly involved in the formation of seamless tubes. One hypothesis is that Zipper\u2019s contractility at the lateral epidermis\u2019 leading edge allows cell sheet movement and respective elongation; as a result of such an elongation, further branching may occur in the elongated region of the cell, hence defining branching morphogenesis in the terminal cells of the tracheal system.</jats:p>",

Bacteria in a newly exposed moraine have to cope with various pressures owing to deglaciation at the glacier snout. However, limited information is available regarding the high diversity and temporary survival of culturable heterotrophic bacteria under various environmental stresses. To examine the tolerance of extremophiles against varying environmental conditions in a newly exposed moraine, we simulated environmental stress in bacterial cultures. The results showed that the isolated strains belonged to actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermus, and Firmicutes. Actinobacteria was the most abundant phylum, followed by Proteobacteria, at both high and low temperatures. Pseudarthrobacter was the most abundant genus, accounting for 14.2% of the total isolates. Although several microorganisms grew at 10 \u00b0C, the proportion of microorganisms that grew at 25 \u00b0C was substantially higher. In particular, 50% of all bacterial isolates grew only at a high temperature (HT), whereas 21.4% of the isolates grew at a low temperature (LT), and 38.6% of the isolates grew at both HT and LT. In addition, many radiation-resistant extremophiles were identified, which adapted to both cold and oxidative conditions. The nearest neighbors of approximately &gt;90% of bacteria belonged to a nonglacial environment, such as oil-contaminated soil, rocks, and black sand, instead of glacial niches. This study provides insights into the ecological traits, stress responses, and temporary survival of culturable heterotrophic bacteria in a newly exposed moraine with variable environmental conditions and the relationship of these communities with the non-glacial environment.

However, the differences disappeared in the first runner generation. To test genetic variations, a total of 102 bands were generated by twelve inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers. A few polymorphic bands were found only in plants derived from TC of IT245860, which was not cryopreserved. The sequencing analysis of four polymorphic bands produced by ISSR_15 showed that none of these sequences matched the characterized genes in NCBI.

To overcome this limitation, the study focuses on the immunohistochemical characterization of the nervous system of Culex pipiens biotype molestus in comparison to Drosophila melanogaster using 13 antibodies labeling nervous tissue, neurotransmitters or neurotransmitter-related enzymes.

In contrast, antibodies directed against acetylcholine, choline acetyltransferase, elav and repo failed to produce a signal in Culex pipiens comparable to that in Drosophila melanogaster.

One of the hallmarks of basic feature extraction is the phenomenon of orientation selectivity, of which the underlying neuronal-level computational mechanisms remain partially unclear despite being intensively investigated. In this work we present a reduced visual system model (RVSM) of the first level of scene analysis, involving the retina, the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual cortex (V1), showing orientation selectivity. The detection core of the RVSM is the neuromorphic spike-decoding structure MNSD, which is able to learn and recognize parallel spike sequences and considerably resembles the neuronal microcircuits of V1 in both topology and operation. This structure is equipped with plasticity of intrinsic excitability to embed recent findings about V1 operation. The RVSM, which embeds 81 groups of MNSD arranged in 4 oriented columns, is tested using sets of rotated Gabor patches as input. Finally, synthetic visual evoked activity generated by the RVSM is compared with real neurophysiological signal from V1 area: (1) postsynaptic activity of human subjects obtained by magnetoencephalography and (2) spiking activity of macaques obtained by multi-tetrode arrays. The system is implemented using the NEST simulator. The results attest to a good level of resemblance between the model response and real neurophysiological recordings. As the RVSM is available online, and the model parameters can be customized by the user, we propose it as a tool to elucidate the computational mechanisms underlying orientation selectivity.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Behaviors may enhance fitness in some situations while being detrimental in others. Linked behaviors (behavioral syndromes) may be central to understanding the maintenance of behavioral variability in natural populations. The spillover hypothesis of premating sexual cannibalism by females explains genetically determined female aggression towards both prey and males: growth to a larger size translates into higher fecundity, but at the risk of insufficient sperm acquisition. Here, we use an individual-based model to determine the ecological scenarios under which this spillover strategy is more likely to evolve over a strategy in which females attack approaching males only once the female has previously secured sperm. We found that a classic spillover strategy could never prevail. However, a more realistic early-spillover strategy, in which females become adults earlier in addition to reaching a larger size, could be maintained in some ecological scenarios and even invade a population of females following the other strategy. We also found under some ecological scenarios that both behavioral types coexist through frequency-dependent selection. Additionally, using data from the spider Lycosa hispanica, we provide strong support for the prediction that the two strategies may coexist in the wild. Our results clarify how animal personalities evolve and are maintained in nature.</jats:p>",

The relationships between four light spectra (red, blue, yellow, and white) and physiological responses (net photosynthetic rate, stomata conductance, transpiration rate, and intercellular CO2 partial pressure), as well as growth responses (shoot and root biomass), were analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis. Among the four physiological response variables, shoot biomass was not increased by any pathway, and root biomass was increased only by the intercellular CO2 partial pressure. Red and yellow light increased shoot biomass, whereas white light promoted an increase in the net photosynthetic rate and enhanced root biomass. In contrast, blue light was less effective than the other light spectra in increasing both shoot and root biomass. Therefore, red and yellow light are the most effective light spectra for increasing shoot biomass and white light is effective for increasing root biomass in a plant factory that uses artificial LED lighting. Furthermore, the intercellular CO2 partial pressure is an important physiological variable for increasing the root biomass of P. ginseng.</jats:p>",

Activation of cell death pathways, such as the emerging forms of non-apoptotic programmed cell death, including ferroptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, NETosis, parthanatos, mitoptosis and paraptosis, may represent clinically relevant novel therapeutic opportunities. This systematic review summarizes the recently described forms of cell death in OSCC, highlighting their potential for informing diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Original studies that explored any of the selected cell deaths in OSCC were included. Electronic search, study selection, data collection and risk of bias assessment tools were realized. The literature search was carried out in four databases, and the extracted data from 79 articles were categorized and grouped by type of cell death. Ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis represented the main forms of cell death in the selected studies, with links to cancer immunity and inflammatory responses, progression and prognosis of OSCC. Harnessing the potential of these pathways may be useful in patient-specific prognosis and individualized therapy. We provide perspectives on how these different cell death types can be integrated to develop decision tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of OSCC.</jats:p>",

It delves into the study of soil-dwelling cellulolytic bacteria and the enzymes they produce, cellulases, which are crucial in both soil formation and the carbon cycle. Forests and agricultural activities are significant contributors to the production of lignocellulosic biomass. Forest ecosystems, which are key carbon sinks, contain 20\u201330% cellulose in their leaf litter. Concurrently, the agricultural sector generates approximately 998 million tons of lignocellulosic waste annually. Predominant genera include Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, and Streptomyces in forests and Bacillus, Streptomyces, Pseudomonas, and Arthrobacter in agricultural soils. Selection of cellulolytic bacteria is based on their hydrolysis ability, using artificial cellulose media and dyes like Congo red or iodine for detection. Some studies also measure cellulolytic activity in vitro. Notably, bacterial cellulose hydrolysis capability may not align with their cellulolytic enzyme production. Enzymes such as GH1, GH3, GH5, GH6, GH8, GH9, GH10, GH12, GH26, GH44, GH45, GH48, GH51, GH74, GH124, and GH148 are crucial, particularly GH48 for crystalline cellulose degradation. Conversely, bacteria with GH5 and GH9 often fail to degrade crystalline cellulose. Accurate identification of cellulolytic bacteria necessitates comprehensive genomic analysis, supplemented by additional proteomic and transcriptomic techniques. Cellulases, known for degrading cellulose, are also significant in healthcare, food, textiles, bio-washing, bleaching, paper production, ink removal, and biotechnology, emphasizing the importance of discovering novel cellulolytic strains in soil.</jats:p>",

The leaf architecture characteristics and epidermal features of the fossil specimens are described in detail here for the first time, and they were assigned to a new species: Comptonia hirsuta. The fruit fossils collected simultaneously from the same layer were assigned to Comptonia tymensis. The global fossil records indicate that the spatial distribution range of Comptonia reached its peak in both the Eocene and Miocene as two warm periods and then gradually decreased in the Oligocene, as well as after the late Miocene, because of the cooling global climate. Furthermore, the Comptonia taxon in East Asia may have migrated from North America via the Bering route in the late Paleocene or Eocene. Plant exchange between western Europe and eastern North America possibly occurred during the Eocene via the Thulean route. Phytogeographic variation in the Comptonia fossils from China also indicates that the reason for the disappearance of Comptonia from China may not only be due to the prolonged cooling and drying after the late Miocene, but also due to its progenitive pattern.</jats:p>",

Besides several biomolecules and microbial stimuli, marine mammal ETosis is also trigged by various terrestrial protozoa and metazoa, considered nowadays as neozoan parasites, which are circulating in oceans worldwide and causing critical emerging marine diseases. Recent studies demonstrated that pinniped- and cetacean-derived polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and monocytes are able to form different phenotypes of ET structures composed of nuclear DNA, histones, and cytoplasmic peptides/proteases against terrestrial apicomplexan parasites, e.g., Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum. Detailed molecular analyses and functional studies proved that marine mammal PMNs and monocytes cast ETs in a similar way as terrestrial mammals, entrapping and immobilizing T. gondii and N. caninum tachyzoites. Pinniped- and cetacean leukocytes induce vital and suicidal ETosis, with highly reliant actions of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and combined mechanisms of myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), and DNA citrullination via peptidylarginine deiminase IV (PAD4).This scoping review intends to summarize the knowledge on emerging protozoans in the marine environment and secondly to review limited data about ETosis mechanisms in marine mammalian species.</jats:p>",

Telomere length investigations in dairy cows included breed effects, estimates of additive genetic control (heritability 0.12 to 0.46), and effects of external stressors on telomere degradation across animal life. Evaluation of telomeres with respect to aging has also been conducted in pigs and horses, and there are fewer reports of telomere biology in beef cattle, sheep, and goats. There were minimal associations of telomere length with animal productivity measures. Most, but not all, work in livestock has documented an inverse relationship between peripheral blood cell telomere length and age; that is, a longer telomere length was associated with younger age.

In patients with ARDS, disturbances in the physiological matching of alveolar ventilation (V) and pulmonary perfusion (Q) (V/Q mismatch) are a hallmark derangement. The perfusion of collapsed or consolidated lung units gives rise to intrapulmonary shunting and arterial hypoxemia, whereas the ventilation of non-perfused lung zones increases physiological dead-space, which potentially necessitates increased ventilation to avoid hypercapnia. Beyond its impact on gas exchange, V/Q mismatch is a predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with ARDS; more recently, its role in ventilation-induced lung injury and worsening lung edema has been described. Innovations in bedside imaging technologies such as electrical impedance tomography readily allow clinicians to determine the regional distributions of V and Q, as well as the adequacy of their matching, providing new insights into the phenotyping, prognostication, and clinical management of patients with ARDS.

It is also a clinically heterogeneous disease that ranges from spontaneous regression to high-risk stage 4 disease. The cause of this disease remains elusive. However, the amplification of NMYC oncogene occurred in roughly 30% of NB patients, which strongly correlated with the advanced stage of disease subtype and the worse prognosis status. We discovered that N-Myc oncoprotein binds and activates INSM1, a zinc-finger transcription factor of neuroendocrine tumors. We also found that INSM1 modulates N-Myc stability mediated through PI3K/AKT/GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathway. Therefore, INSM1 emerges as a critical co-player with N-Myc in facilitating NB tumor cell growth and sustaining the advanced stage of malignancy. Using an INSM1-promoter driven luciferase screening-platform, we have recently identified fifteen small molecules that negatively regulate INSM1 expression. Interestingly, the identified small molecules can be divided into four large groups of compounds such as cell signaling inhibitor, DNA/RNA inhibitor, HDAC inhibitor, and cardiac glycoside. These findings support the presence of a unique mechanism associated with INSM1 and N-Myc interplay, which is critical in regulating NB tumor cell growth. We discuss the feasibility of identifying novel or repurposing small molecules targeting INSM1 as a potential treatment option for high-risk NB.</jats:p>",

In particular, this study is an accurate description of the mycobiota present in the bulk soil of two different high altitude pear orchards in the Colombian Andes. The metabarcoding of soil samples allowed an in-depth analysis of the whole fungal community. The fungal assemblage was generally dominated by Ascomycota and secondly by Mortierellomycota. As observed in other studies in Colombia, the genus Mortierella was found to be especially abundant. The soil of the different pear orchards appeared to host quite different fungal communities according to the soil physico-chemical properties. The common mycobiota contained 35 fungal species, including several species of Mortierella, Humicola, Solicoccozyma and Exophiala. Moreover, most of the identified fungal species (79%) were recorded for the first time in Colombian soils, thus adding important information on soil biodiversity regarding both Colombia and pear orchards.</jats:p>",

All plastomes were conservative in genome size, gene number, structure, and IR boundary. Repeat sequence analysis showed that forward and palindrome repeats were the most common repeat types. The number of SSRs ranged from 30 (Sartidia isaloensis) to 54 (Aristida purpurea). Codon usage analysis showed that plastome genes preferred to use codons ending with A/T. A total of 12 highly variable regions were screened, including four protein coding sequences (matK, ndhF, infA, and rpl32) and eight non-coding sequences (rpl16-1-rpl16-2, ccsA-ndhD, trnY-GUA-trnD-GUC, ndhF-rpl32, petN-trnC-GCA, trnT-GGU-trnE-UUC, trnG-GCC-trnfM-CAU, and rpl32-trnL-UAG). Furthermore, the phylogenetic position of this subfamily and their intergeneric relationships need to be illuminated. All Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference trees strongly support the monophyly of Aristidoideae and each of three genera, and the clade of Aristidoideae and Panicoideae was a sister to other subfamilies in the PACMAD clade. Within Aristidoideae, Aristida is a sister to the clade composed of Stipagrostis and Sartidia.

We analyzed the protein levels by Western blotting and the enzymatic activities of proteins involved in mitochondrial function, as well as the amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), by real-time PCR, analyzing samples of non-tumor adjacent tissue and tumor tissue from stages III and IV CRC patients without radio- or chemotherapy treatment prior to surgery. Our data indicate that the tumor tissue of pre-metastatic stage III CRC exhibited an oxidant metabolic profile very similar to the samples of non-tumor adjacent tissue of both stages. Notable differences in the protein expression levels of ATPase, IDH2, LDHA, and SIRT1, as well as mtDNA amount, were detected between the samples of non-tumor adjacent tissue and tumor tissue from metastatic CRC patients. These findings suggest a shift in the oxidative metabolic profile that takes place in the tumor tissue once the metastatic stage has been reached. Tumor tissue oxidative metabolism contributes to promote and maintain the metastatic phenotype, with evidence of mitochondrial function impairment in stage IV tumor tissue.</jats:p>",

Targeted removal of senescent cells in preclinical models promotes health and longevity, suggesting that the selective elimination of senescent cells is a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating a myriad of age-related pathologies in humans. However, moving senescence-targeting drugs (senotherapeutics) into the clinic will require therapeutic targets and biomarkers, fueled by an improved understanding of the complex and dynamic biology of senescent cell populations and their molecular profiles, as well as the mechanisms underlying the emergence and maintenance of senescence cells and the SASP. Advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies and workflows have the potential to address these needs.

Further, we lay out a roadmap from fundamental biological discovery to the clinical translation of senotherapeutic approaches through the development and application of emerging proteomic technologies, including targeted and untargeted proteomic approaches, bottom-up and top-down methods, stability proteomics, and surfaceomics.

Oryza sativa has 11 OsOSCA genes; some of these were shown to complement hyperosmolality-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases (OICIcyt), salt stress-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases (SICIcyt), and the associated growth phenotype in the Arabidopsis thaliana mutant osca1. However, their biological functions in rice remain unclear. In this paper, we found that OsOSCA1.1 mediates OICIcyt and SICIcyt in rice roots, which are critical for stomatal closure, plant survival, and gene expression in shoots, in response to hyperosmolality and the salt stress treatment of roots. Compared with wild-type (Zhonghua11, ZH11) plants, OICIcyt and SICIcyt were abolished in the roots of 10-day-old ososca1.1 seedlings, in response to treatment with 250 mM of sorbitol and 100 mM of NaCl, respectively. Moreover, hyperosmolality- and salt stress-induced stomatal closure were also disrupted in a 30-day-old ososca1.1 mutant, resulting in lower stomatal resistance and survival rates than that in ZH11. However, overexpression of OsOSCA1.1 in ososca1.1 complemented stomatal movement and survival, in response to hyperosmolality and salt stress. The transcriptomic analysis further revealed the following three types of OsOSCA1.1-regulated genes in the shoots: 2416 sorbitol-responsive, 2349 NaCl-responsive and 1844 common osmotic stress-responsive genes after treated with 250 mM of sorbitol and 125 mM NaCl of in 30-day-old rice roots for 24 h. The Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that these OsOSCA1.1-regulated genes were relatively enriched in transcription regulation, hormone response, and phosphorylation terms of the biological processes category, which is consistent with the Cis-regulatory elements ABRE, ARE, MYB and MYC binding motifs that were overrepresented in 2000-bp promoter regions of these OsOSCA1.1-regulated genes.

Our previous studies reported that alcohol consumption elevates the numbers and sizes of LDs in hepatocytes, which is attenuated by simultaneous treatment with the methyl group donor, betaine. Here, we examined changes in the hepatic lipidome with respect to LD size and dynamics in male Wistar rats fed for 6 weeks with control or ethanol-containing liquid diets that were supplemented with or without 10 mg betaine/mL. At the time of sacrifice, three hepatic LD fractions, LD1 (large droplets), LD2 (medium-sized droplets), and LD3 (small droplets) were isolated from each rat. Untargeted lipidomic analyses revealed that each LD fraction of ethanol-fed rats had higher phospholipids, cholesteryl esters, diacylglycerols, ceramides, and hexosylceramides compared with the corresponding fractions of pair-fed controls. Interestingly, the ratio of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine (the two most abundant phospholipids on the LD surface) was lower in LD1 fraction compared with LD3 fraction, irrespective of treatment; however, this ratio was significantly lower in ethanol LD fractions compared with their respective control fractions. Betaine supplementation significantly attenuated the ethanol-induced lipidomic changes. These were mainly associated with the regulation of LD surface phospholipids, ceramides, and glycerolipid metabolism in different-sized LD fractions. In conclusion, our results show that ethanol-induced changes in the hepatic LD lipidome likely stabilizes larger-sized LDs during steatosis development. Furthermore, betaine supplementation could effectively reduce the size and dynamics of LDs to attenuate alcohol-associated hepatic steatosis.</jats:p>",

These drugs exert their therapeutic effect by causing a systemic osteoclast depletion that, in turn, is responsible for reduced bone resorption. Unfortunately, in addition to their beneficial activity, BPs can also determine a frightening side effect known as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). It is generally believed that the inability of osteoclasts to dispose of inflamed/necrotic bone represents the main physiopathological aspect of ONJ. In principle, a therapeutic strategy able to elicit a local re-activation of osteoclast production could counteract ONJ and promote the healing of its lesions. Using an experimental model of Vitamin D3-dependent osteoclastogenesis, we have previously demonstrated that Magnesium is a powerful inducer of osteoclast differentiation. Here we show that, surprisingly, this effect is greatly enhanced by the presence of Zoledronate, chosen for our study because it is the most effective and dangerous of the BPs.

        "abstract": "<jats:p>There are increasing incidences of elderly patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). However, the treatment is not yet established. We conducted a propensity score matching analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tegafur\u2013uracil versus 5-fluorouracil in combination with cisplatin plus cetuximab in elderly patients with R/M HNSCC. Elderly patients with R/M HNSCC treated with cetuximab-containing chemotherapy were recruited into this study. In order to reduce the selection bias, propensity score matching was performed. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves were plotted for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Common Terminology Criteria V3.0. After propensity sore matching, 54 patients with tegafur\u2013uracil, cisplatin plus cetuximab (UPEx), and 54 patients with 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin plus cetuximab (EXTREME) were identified. The median PFS was 5.4 months in UPEx and 5.8 months in EXTREME (p = 0.451). The median OS was 10.8 months in UPEx and 10.2 months in EXTREME (p = 0.807). The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were insignificant in both arms, accounting for 61% versus 59% (p = 0.680) and 72% versus 70% (p = 0.732) in the UPEx arm and the EXTREME arm, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that age and ECOG PS were, independently, predictors. Grade 3/4 adverse events were much fewer in UPEx than in EXTREME (p &lt; 0.001). Both cetuximab-containing chemotherapies are effective in elderly patients with R/M HNSCC. Safety profiles are improved when tegafur\u2013uracil is substituted for 5-fluorouracil. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate our conclusions.</jats:p>",

Through a collaboration between a scientific laboratory and government institution in Chile, 63 samples were analyzed. Thirty-nine samples were successfully identified to the species level. In total, 17 species of six families were detected, including six species of conservation interest. Of the 39 samples, 29 corresponded to corroborations of field identifications. Seven corresponded to unidentified samples and three to corrected misidentifications, adding up to 28% of the identified samples. Sex was successfully identified for 58 of the 63 individuals. Twenty were corroborations, 34 were previously unidentified, and four were corrections. Applying this method improves the stranding database of Chile and provides new data for future management and conservation tasks.</jats:p>",

EMT is a plastic process and tumor cells may shift between different epithelial-mesenchymal states during metastasis. However, how this is regulated is not fully understood. Syndecan-1 (SDC1) is the major cell surface proteoglycan in epithelial cells and has been shown to regulate carcinoma progression and EMT. Recently, it was discovered that SDC1 translocates into the cell nucleus in certain tumor cells. Nuclear SDC1 inhibits cell proliferation, but whether nuclear SDC1 contributes to the regulation of EMT is not clear. Here, we report that loss of nuclear SDC1 is associated with cellular elongation and an E-cadherin-to-N-cadherin switch during TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Further studies showed that nuclear translocation of SDC1 contributed to the repression of mesenchymal and invasive properties of human B6FS fibrosarcoma cells. The results demonstrate that nuclear translocation contributes to the capacity of SDC1 to regulate epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in human tumor cells and opens up to mechanistic studies to elucidate the mechanisms involved.</jats:p>",

A total of 86 peptide traces were identified using liquid-chromatography\u2013electrospray-ionisation mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). Among them, three peptides were sequenced using the manual de novo sequencing technique. The in-silico prediction revealed that SA923 is a cyclic peptide with C-N terminal interaction of the carbon atom of ASP7 with the nitrogen atom of GLU1 (1ELVFYRD7). Thus, SA923 is presented under the orbitides class of peptides, which lack the disulfide bonds for cyclization. In addition, SA923, steered with the physicochemical properties and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm mentioned for the segment, has the highest in silico anticancer potential. Further, the in vitro cytotoxicity assay revealed the peptide has anti-proliferative activity, and toxicity studies were demonstrated in Danio rerio (zebrafish) embryos.</jats:p>",

We discovered that the expression of novel miRNAs was lower than known miRNAs. Furthermore, compared to known miRNAs, novel miRNAs are prone to expression in a stage-specific manner. Upon DENV infection, a total of 44 novel miRNAs were differentially expressed, and target prediction analysis revealed that miRNA-target genes were involved in lipid metabolism and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. Taken together, the miRNA annotation profile provided here is the most comprehensive to date.

ERK1/2 inhibition by U0126 induced a stronger dephosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates and activated AKT. The concomitant inhibition of ERK1/2 and AKT further dephosphorylated 4EBP1 and further increased Q- or Rap-mediated cytotoxicity, compared to the single ERK1/2 or AKT inhibition in cells undergoing Q- or Rap-treatments. Moreover, quercetin or rapamycin reduced autophagy, particularly when used in combination with the ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126. This effect was not dependent on TFEB localization in nuclei or cytoplasm or on the transcription of different autophagy genes, but did correlate with the reduction in protein translation due to a strong eIF2\u03b1-Ser51 phosphorylation. Thus, ERK1/2, by limiting 4EBP1 de-phosphorylation and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, behaves as a paladin of protein synthesis. Based on these findings, the combined inhibition of mTORC1, ERK1/2, and AKT should be considered in treatment of AML.</jats:p>",

Here, we explore the influence of chronic corticosterone (CORT) exposure on copper metabolism and its regulatory mechanism in mice. Mice were treated with 100 \u03bcg/mL CORT in drinking water for a 4-week trial. We found that CORT treatment resulted in a significant decrease in plasma copper level, plasma ceruloplasmin activity, plasma and liver Cu/Zn-SOD activity, hepatic copper content, and liver metallothionein content in mice. CORT treatment led to the reduction in duodenal expression of copper transporter 1 (CTR1), duodenal cytochrome b (DCYTB), and ATPase copper-transporting alpha (ATP7A) at the mRNA and protein level in mice. CORT treatment activated nuclear glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and down-regulated CRT1 expression in Caco-2 cells, whereas these phenotypes were reversible by an antagonist of GR, RU486. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that GR bound to the Ctr1 promoter in Caco-2 cells. Transient transfection assays in Caco-2 cells demonstrated that the Ctr1 promoter was responsive to the CORT-activated glucocorticoid receptor, whereas mutation/deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor element (GRE) markedly impaired activation of the Ctr1 promoter. In addition, CORT-induced downregulation of Ctr1 promoter activity was markedly attenuated in Caco-2 cells when RU486 was added. These findings present a novel molecular target for CORT that down-regulates intestinal CTR1 expression via GR-mediated trans-repression in mice.</jats:p>",

In this study, we aimed to analyze, using integrative metagenomics, the predominant species and metabolic routes involved in SCFAs production in the human gut microbiome after treatment with CMH. The effect of CMH treatment on the Thai gut microbiome was demonstrated using 16S rRNA genes with whole-metagenome shotgun (WMGS) sequencing technology. Accordingly, these results revealed that CMH has potentially beneficial effects on the gut microbiome. Twelve predominant bacterial species, as well as their potential metabolic routes, were involved in cooperative microbiome networks under sugar utilization (e.g., glucose, mannose, or xylose) and energy supply (e.g., NADH and ATP) in relation to SCFAs biosynthesis. These findings suggest that CMH may be used as a potential prebiotic diet for modulating and maintaining the gut microbiome.

MRAP2 proteins exist as parallel or antiparallel dimers on the plasma membrane, but the structural insight of dual orientations with the pharmacological profiles has not yet been fully studied. Investigation and optimization of the conformational topology of MRAP2 are critical for the development of transmembrane allosteric modulators to treat MC4R-associated disorders. In this study, we synthesized a brand new single transmembrane protein by reversing wild-type mouse and zebrafish MRAP2 sequences and examined their dimerization, interaction and pharmacological activities on mouse and zebrafish MC4R signaling. We showed that the reversed zebrafish MRAPa exhibited an opposite function on modulating zMC4R signaling and the reversed mouse MRAP2 lost the capability for regulating MC4R trafficking but exhibited a novel function for cAMP cascades, despite proper expression and folding. Taken together, our results provided new biochemical insights on the oligomeric states and membrane orientations of MRAP2 proteins, as well as its pharmacological assistance for modulating MC4R signaling.</jats:p>",

Through the case study of a massive occurrence of A. cerata (21 April 2018), the species contents (~85% of the flying population) and active periods of a sympatric population comprising A. cerata and L. kagiana were successfully evaluated by FI pattern matching, as well as field specimen collections. Our study suggests that FI patterns may be a reliable species-specific luminous marker for monitoring the behavioral changes in a sympatric firefly population in the field, and has implication values for firefly conservation.</jats:p>",

Inflammation-related genes, including genes for Toll-like receptors (TLRs), are tightly controlled by several microRNAs that, in addition to their pivotal role in the epigenetic regulation of target genes, are ligands for TLR activation and downstream signaling. Thus, we evaluated the association between OA risk and genetic variants in TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR9, and microRNAs that regulate TLRs signaling miR146a, miR155, and miR196a2. Our study group consisted of 95 surgically treated OA patients and a control group of 104 healthy individuals. Genetic polymorphisms were determined using TaqMan real-time PCR assays (Applied Biosystems). Adjusted logistic regression analysis demonstrated that polymorphisms in TLR4 rs4986790 (OR = 2.964, p = 0.006), TLR4 rs4986791 (OR = 8.766, p = 0.00001), and TLR7 rs385389 (OR = 1.579, p = 0.012) increased OA risk, while miR-196a2 rs11614913 (OR = 0.619, p = 0.034) was significantly associated with decreased OA risk. Our findings indicate that polymorphisms in the TLR4 and TLR7 genes might increase OA risk and suggest a novel association of miR-196a2 polymorphism with decreased OA susceptibility. The modulation of TLRs and miRNAs and their cross-talk might be an attractive target for a personalized approach to OA management.</jats:p>",

In recent years, significant molecular and genetic abnormalities associated with CD have been described.

Genes affecting chromatin organization and abnormalities in methylation are seen more commonly in iMCD while abnormalities within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and interleukin signaling pathways are more frequent in UCD. Interestingly, there is a paucity of genetic studies evaluating HHV-8 positive multicentric CD (HHV-8+ MCD) and POEMS-associated CD.

We evaluated the influence of hyperproteinemia on innate immunity. The results showed that high PPC enhanced hemolymph phagocytosis via inducing a rapid increase in granulocytes. Moreover, while oenocytoids increased, the plasmacytes quickly dwindled. High PPC inhibited hemolymph melanization due to decreased phenoloxidase (PO) activity in the hemolymph via inhibiting the expression of the prophenoloxidase-encoding genes, PPO1 and PPO2. High PPC upregulated the gene expression of antimicrobial peptides via differential activation of the Toll and Imd signaling pathways associated with NF-\u03baB signaling, followed by an induction of inconsistent antibacterial activity towards Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in an animal model of high PPC. Therefore, high PPC has multiple significant effects on the innate immune function of the silkworm circulatory system.</jats:p>",

In this study, the optimized MaxEnt model was used to analyse the key environmental variables related to the distribution of A. chensiensis based on 93 wild distribution records and six environmental variables. The potential distribution areas of A. chensiensis in the last interglacial (LIG), the last glacial maximum (LGM), the current period, and the 2050s and 2070s were simulated. Our results showed that temperature is critical to the distribution of A. chensiensis, with the mean temperature of the coldest quarter being the most important climatic factor affecting the distribution of this species. In addition, ecological niche modeling analysis showed that the A. chensiensis distribution area in the last interglacial experiencing population expansion and, during the last glacial maximum occurring, a population contraction. Under the emission scenarios in the 2050s and 2070s, the suitable distribution area would contract significantly, and the migration routes of the centroids tended to migrate toward the southern high-altitude mountains, suggesting a strong response from the A. chensiensis distribution to climate change.

There were no significant changes in the 3000-metre time trial or in the haematocrit percentage. The changes in percentage of reticulocytes, heart rate, maximal heart rate, lactate concentration and erythropoietin were heterogeneous between the different research studies. Conclusion: short exposure (less than 3 h to normobaric hypoxia significantly increases the time to exhaustion). However, longer exposure times are necessary to increase haemoglobin.

The latter is caused by the ability of this pathogen to secrete secondary metabolites, enabling it to colonize inside the host causing infection through various processes. Metallophores are secondary metabolites that enable bacteria to sequester metal ions from the surrounding environment since the availability of metal ions is crucial for bacterial metabolism and virulence. The uptake of iron and other metal ions such as nickel and zinc is one of these essential mechanisms that gives this germ its virulence properties and allow it to overcome the host immune system. Additionally, extensive interactions occur between this pathogen and other bacteria as they compete for resources. Staphylococcus aureus has high-affinity metal import pathways including metal ions acquisition, recruitment and metal\u2013chelate complex import. These characteristics give this bacterium the ability to intake metallophores synthesized by other bacteria, thus enabling it to compete with other microorganisms for the limited nutrients. In scarce host conditions, free metal ions are extremely low because they are confined to storage and metabolic molecules, so metal ions are sequestered by metallophores produced by this bacterium. Both siderophores (iron chelating molecules) and staphylopine (wide- spectrum metallophore) are secreted by Staphylococcus aureus giving it infectious properties. The genetic regulation of the synthesis and export together with the import of metal loaded metallophores are well established and are all covered in this review.</jats:p>",

With the acceleration of climate change, climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases (VBDs) pose an increasing threat to public health. This paper summaries 10 publications on the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and human health; then it synthesizes the other existing literature to more broadly explain how climate change drives the transmission and spread of VBDs through an ecological perspective. We highlight the multi-dimensional nature of climate change, its interaction with other factors, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on transmission and spread of VBDs, specifically including: (1) the generally nonlinear relationship of local climate (temperature, precipitation and wind) and VBD transmission, with temperature especially exhibiting an n-shape relation; (2) the time-lagged effect of regional climate phenomena (the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation) on VBD transmission; (3) the u-shaped effect of extreme climate (heat waves, cold waves, floods, and droughts) on VBD spread; (4) how interactions between non-climatic (land use and human mobility) and climatic factors increase VBD transmission and spread; and (5) that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on climate change is debatable, and its impact on VBDs remains uncertain. By exploring the influence of climate change and non-climatic factors on VBD transmission and spread, this paper provides scientific understanding and guidance for their effective prevention and control.</jats:p>",

The ability of S. aureus to produce biofilm is a significant virulence factor, triggering its persistence in hostile environments. In this study, we screened a total of 420 different food samples and human hand swabs to detect S. aureus and to determine their biofilm formation ability. Samples analyzed were meat, milk, eggs, fish, fast foods, and hand swabs. S. aureus were detected by culturing, staining, biochemical, and PCR. Biofilm formation ability was determined by Congo Red Agar (CRA) plate and Crystal Violet Microtiter Plate (CVMP) tests. The icaA, icaB, icaC, icaD, and bap genes involved in the synthesis of biofilm-forming intracellular adhesion compounds were detected by PCR. About 23.81% (100/420; 95% CI: 14.17\u201329.98%) of the samples harbored S. aureus, as revealed by detection of the nuc gene. The CRA plate test revealed 20% of S. aureus isolates as strong biofilm producers and 69% and 11% as intermediate and non-biofilm producers, respectively. By the CVMP staining method, 20%, 77%, and 3% of the isolates were found to be strong, intermediate, and non-biofilm producers. Furthermore, 21% of S. aureus isolates carried at least one biofilm-forming gene, where icaA, icaB, icaC, icaD, and bap genes were detected in 15%, 20%, 7%, 20%, and 10% of the S. aureus isolates, respectively. Bivariate analysis showed highly significant correlations (p &lt; 0.001) between any of the two adhesion genes of S. aureus isolates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in Bangladesh describing the detection of biofilm-forming S. aureus from foods and hand swabs using molecular-based evidence. Our findings suggest that food samples should be deemed a potential reservoir of biofilm-forming S. aureus, which indicates a potential public health significance.</jats:p>",

Yet, not all cancer cells are susceptible to anti-ILK treatment alone. We investigate a combination drug strategy targeting ILK and another oncogenic kinase, Abelson kinase (ABL). Drug-concentration viability assays (i.e., MTT assays) indicate that ILK and ABL inhibitors in combination decreased the viability of glioblastoma cells over the ILK drug QLT-0267 alone. Combination strategies also increased aberrant mitoses and cell death over QLT-0267 alone. This was evident from an increase in mitotic arrest, apoptosis and a sub-G1 peak following FAC analysis. In vitro, ILK and ABL localized to the centrosome and the putative ILK kinase domain was important for this localization. Increased levels of cytosolic ABL are associated with its transformative abilities. ILK inhibitor effects on survival correlated with its ability to decrease cytosolic ABL levels and inhibit ABL\u2019s localization to mitotic centrosomes in glioblastoma cells. ILK inhibitor effects on ABL\u2019s centrosomal localization were reversed by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (a drug that inhibits ABL degradation). These results indicate that ILK regulates ABL at mitotic centrosomes and that combination treatments targeting ILK and ABL are more effective then QLT-0267 alone at decreasing the survival of dividing glioblastoma cells.</jats:p>",

Our results showed that one of the picocyanobacteria, Synechococcus, mainly distributed in the surface water layer regardless of seasonal changes, and the cell abundance ranged from 104 to 105 cells mL\u22121. In contrast, the maximum concentration of the other picocyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus, was maintained at more than 105 cells mL\u22121 throughout the year. In the summer and the autumn, Prochlorococcus were mainly concentrated at the water layer near the bottom of the euphotic zone. They were evenly distributed in the euphotic zone in the spring and winter. The stirring effect caused by the monsoon determined their distribution in the water column. In addition, the results of 16S rRNA gene diversity analysis showed that the seasonal changes in the relative abundance of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus in the surface water of each station accounted for 20 to 40% of the total reads. The clade II of Synechococcus and the High-light II of Prochlorococcus were the dominant strains in the waters all year round. Regarding other picoplankton, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria occupied 45% and 10% of the total picoplankton in the four seasons. These data should be helpful for elucidating the impacts of global climate changes on marine ecology and biogeochemical cycles in the Western Boundary Currents in the future.</jats:p>",

A previous study used microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA data to establish the criteria for identifying species and their hybrids; however, the results may have been influenced by biased allelic frequencies and genetic drift within the examined population. To overcome these limitations and identify the true signals of selection, alternative DNA markers and a diverse set of populations should be employed. Therefore, this study used DArT sequencing to identify genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in both species and confirm the genetic scenario of the parental species and their hybrids. A population of saltwater crocodiles from Australia was used to compare the distribution of species-diagnostic SNPs. Different analytical approaches were compared to diagnose the level of hybridization when an admixture was present, wherein three individuals had potential backcrossing. Approximately 17.00\u201326.00% of loci were conserved between the Siamese and saltwater crocodile genomes. Species-diagnostic SNP loci for Siamese and saltwater crocodiles were identified as 8051 loci and 1288 loci, respectively. To validate the species-diagnostic SNP loci, a PCR-based approach was used by selecting 20 SNP loci for PCR primer design, among which 3 loci were successfully able to differentiate the actual species and different hybridization levels. Mitochondrial and nuclear genetic information, including microsatellite genotyping and species-diagnostic DNA markers, were combined as a novel method that can compensate for the limitations of each method. This method enables conservation prioritization before release into the wild, thereby ensuring sustainable genetic integrity for long-term species survival through reintroduction and management programs.</jats:p>",

This was confirmed by cell growth inhibition and alteration in metabolic activity evaluated by cell count and MTT assay. GS induced reduction in Pro-caspase 9, 3, but not PARP cleavage nor DNA fragmentation. Thus, in GS-induced cytotoxicity, cell death is not associated with apoptosis. In this context, short-term treatment of U87Mg cells with GS extract (1 mg/mL) reduced the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and of its downstream target P70 S6 kinase, highlighting the role of GS extract into autophagy induction. The activation of autophagic flux by GS extract was confirmed by Western blot analysis, which revealed the reduction in p62 and the concomitant increase in LC3B II/I ratio. Immunofluorescence evidenced the accumulation of LC3B puncta in U87Mg cells pretreated with autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1. Furthermore, as main key regulators of type II programmed cell death, p53, p21 and CDK4 were also investigated and were inhibited by GS treatment.

Since more than sixty years, the Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis mouse model is the experimental model used to investigate viral myocarditis. The pathogenesis of viral myocarditis is conceptually a multiphase process, initiated by the infection of cardiomyocytes, followed by activation of the immune system, and resulting in myocardial fibrosis and left ventricular dysfunction. In parallel to the direct infection of the heart, CVB3 replicates in lymphatic organs such as the pancreas. Due to infection of the pancreas, the model of experimental CVB3-induced myocarditis is estimated as a severe burden for the challenged animals. Application of analgesics in frame of the animal welfare act (European directive 2010/63/EU) is more and more becoming a matter of debate. For this purpose, we summarized published studies for 13 different opioids and discussed their potential impact on CVB3-induced myocarditis. In addition, with this summary we also want to provide guidance for researchers beyond the myocarditis field to estimate the impact of opioids on the immune system for their specific model. In the literature, both immunosuppressive as well as immune-activating effects of opioids have been described, but examinations in experimental CVB3-induced myocarditis have still not been reported so far. Based on the existing publications, administration of opioids in experimental CVB3-induced myocarditis might result in more severe disease progression, including higher mortality, or a less pronounced myocarditis model, failing to be used for the establishment of new treatment options. Taken together, the applicability of opioids in experimental CVB3-induced myocarditis and in inflammatory models in general needs to be carefully evaluated and further investigated.</jats:p>",

In myeloid neoplasms, CD9 is involved in the altered interactions between leukemic and stromal cells. However, apart from its role in CD34+ progenitors and myeloid and megakaryocytic differentiation, its function in normal and leukemic pluripotent cells has not yet been determined. Very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) are promising pluripotent stem cells found in adult tissues that can be developed for safe and efficient regenerative medicine. VSELs express different surface receptors of the highest importance in cell functioning, including CD9, and can be effectively mobilized after organ injury or in leukemic patients. In the present study, we observed that CD9 is among the most expressed receptors in VSELs under steady-state conditions; however, once the VSELs are expanded, CD9+ VSELs decrease and are more apoptotic. CD9\u2013 VSELs had no proliferative improvement in vitro compared to those that were CD9+. Interestingly, the addition of SDF-1 induced CD9 expression on the surface of VSELs, as observed by flow cytometry, and improved their migration. In addition, we observed, in the phenotypically identical VSELs present in the peripheral blood of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, compared to healthy subjects, a significantly higher number of CD9+ cells. However, in their hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) counterparts, the expression remained comparable. These results indicate that, likewise, in progenitors and mature cells, CD9 may play an important function in normal and malignant VSELs. This could explain the refractoriness observed by some groups of expanded stem cells to repairing efficiently damaged tissue when used as a source in cell therapies. Understanding the function of the CD9 receptor in normal and malignant CD34+ and VSELs, along with its relationship with the CXCR4/SDF-1 pathway, will enable advances in the field of adult pluripotent cell usage in regenerative medicine and in their role in leukemia.</jats:p>",

Obviously, current conventional methods for cardiotoxicity assessment suffer from a lack of predictivity and sensitivity. Therefore, there is a need for developing new tools to better identify and characterize any cardiotoxicity that can occur during the pre-clinical and clinical phases of drug development as well as after marketing in exposed patients. In this study, isoproterenol and clarithromycin were used as prototypical cardiotoxic agents in rats in order to evaluate potential biomarkers of heart toxicity at very early stages using 1H-NMR-based metabonomics. While isoproterenol is known to cause heart necrosis, clarithromycin may induce QT interval prolongation. Heart necrosis and QT prolongation were validated by histological analysis, serum measurement of lactate dehydrogenase/creatine phosphate kinase and QTc measurement by electrocardiogram (ECG). Urine samples were collected before and repeatedly during daily exposure to the drugs for 1H-NMR based-metabonomics investigations. Specific metabolic signatures, characteristic of each tested drug, were obtained from which potential predictive biomarkers for drug-induced heart necrosis and drug-induced QT prolongation were retrieved. Isoproterenol-induced heart necrosis was characterized by higher levels of taurine, creatine, glucose and by lower levels of Krebs cycle intermediates, creatinine, betaine/trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), dimethylamine (DMA)/sarcosine. Clarithromycin-induced QT prolongation was characterized by higher levels of creatinine, taurine, betaine/TMAO and DMA/sarcosine and by lower levels of Krebs cycle intermediates, glucose and hippurate.</jats:p>",

Moreover, there is a lack of a standardized method to measure NETosis in an unbiased and robust manner. In this study, we employed the Incucyte\u00ae ZOOM live-cell imaging platform to study NETosis levels in various subtypes of adult and pediatric T1D donors compared to healthy controls (HC) at baseline and in response to phorbol\u2013myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. Firstly, we determined that the technique allows for an operator-independent and automated quantification of NET formation across multiple time points, which showed that PMA and ionomycin induced NETosis with distinct kinetic characteristics, confirmed by high-resolution microscopy. NETosis levels also showed a clear dose-response curve to increasing concentrations of both stimuli. Overall, using Incucyte\u00ae ZOOM, no aberrant NET formation was observed over time in the different subtypes of T1D populations, irrespective of age, compared to HC. These data were corroborated by the levels of peripheral NET markers in all study participants. The current study showed that live-cell imaging allows for a robust and unbiased analysis and quantification of NET formation in real-time.

Although M\u00d8s are highly active phagocytic cells with the capacity to destroy pathogens, they additionally comprise the host cells for Leishmania infection, replication, and stable establishment in the mammal host. The present study compares, for the first time, the innate immune response to L. infantum infection of two different macrophage lineages: the blood macrophages and the liver macrophages (Kupffer cells, KC). Our findings showed that L. infantum takes advantage of the natural predisposition of blood-M\u00d8s to phagocyte pathogens. However, parasites rapidly subvert the mechanisms of M\u00d8s immune activation. On the other hand, KCs, which are primed for immune tolerance, are not extensively activated and can overcome the dormancy induced by the parasite, exhibiting a selection of immune mechanisms, such as extracellular trap formation. Altogether, KCs reveal a different pattern of response in contrast with blood-M\u00d8s when confronting L. infantum parasites. In addition, KCs response appears to be more efficient in managing parasite infection, thus contributing to the ability of the liver to naturally restrain Leishmania dissemination.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the F8I22I mouse showed a deficiency of FVIII activity (10.9 vs. 0 ng/mL in WT and F8I22I, p &lt; 0.0001) and severe coagulation disorder phenotype in the activated partial thromboplastin time (38 vs. 480 s, p &lt; 0.0001), in vivo bleeding test (blood loss/body weight; 0.4 vs. 2.1%, p &lt; 0.0001), and calibrated automated thrombogram assays (Thrombin generation peak, 183 vs. 21.5 nM, p = 0.0012). Moreover, histological changes related to spontaneous bleeding were observed in the liver, spleen, and lungs. We present a novel HA mouse model mimicking human F8I22I. With a structural similarity with human F8I22I, the F8I22I mouse model will be applicable to the evaluation of general hemophilia drugs and the development of gene-editing-based therapy research.</jats:p>",

Currently, several pharmacological studies have revealed that A. distichum extract exhibits diverse biological functions, including anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we present the anti-osteoporotic activity of A. distichum extract by inhibiting osteoclast formation. First, we show that the methanolic extract of the leaves of A. distichum, but not extracts of the branches or fruits, significantly inhibits receptor activator of the NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation. Second, our transcriptome analysis revealed that the leaf extract (LE) blocks sets of RANKL-mediated osteoclast-related genes. Third, the LE attenuates the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase. Finally, treatment with the LE effectively prevents postmenopausal bone loss in ovariectomized mice and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in zebrafish. Our findings show that the extract of A. distichum efficiently suppressed osteoclastogenesis by regulating osteoclast-related genes, thus offering a novel therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis.</jats:p>",

Aerial parts of the rustyback fern do not contain monoterpene-type, sesquiterpene-type, and diterpene-type hydrocarbons or corresponding terpenoids. Online detection of VOCs using proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR\u2013MS) showed a significant increase in emission intensity of dominant volatiles during the first hours of the rehydration process. Twelve hours after re-watering, emission of detected volatiles had returned to the basal levels that corresponded to hydrated plants. During the early phase of rehydration malondialdehyde (MDA) content in fronds, as an indicator of membrane damage, decreased rapidly which implies that lipoxygenase activity is not stimulated during the recovery process of rustyback fern.</jats:p>",

Part of these innovative anticancer therapies address cytoskeletal microtubules (MTs) since specific tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) are considered markers of tumour plasticity. In vitro studies, which traditionally employ two-dimensional (2D) culture systems, are now being replaced by three-dimensional (3D) systems that more closely mimic in vivo physiological conditions and allow a better understanding of the signalling between cells. In this work, we compared 2 liquid base 3D methods for the generation of spheroids from C6 rat glioma cells (RGCs) using 30 \u00b5L of liquid marble (LM) or the hanging drops (HDs), which contained 2 different cell numbers (5000 or 15,000). After 24 or 48 h of in vitro culture (IVC), the morphology of the spheroids was observed and the behaviour of the two main tubulin PTMs, tyrosinated \u03b1-tubulin (Tyr-T) and acetylated \u03b1-tubulin (Ac-T), was evaluated by fluorescence and Western blot (WB). RGCs spontaneously formed spherical agglomerates more rapidly in the LM than in the HD system. Cell density influenced the size of the spheroids, which reached a larger size (&gt; of 300 \u00b5m \u00d8), with 15,000 cells compared to 5000 cells (150 \u00b5m \u00d8). Moreover, an increase in Tyr-T and Ac-T was observed in both the HD and LM system from 24 to 48 h, with the highest values shown in the 48 h/LM spheroids of 5000 cells (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, by comparing the morphology and microtubular architecture of spheroids from C6 rat glioma cells developed by LM or HD methodology, our findings demonstrate that the use of a fumed silica microbioreactor boosts the induction and maintenance of a high plasticity state in glioma cells. RGCs cultured in LM express levels of tubulin PTMs that can be used to evaluate the efficacy of new anticancer therapies.</jats:p>",

Similar retinal microvascular changes were observed in Alzheimer\u2019s and chronic stressed individuals. Hence, we aimed to show that chronic stress relates to T3D dementia signs and retinopathy, ultimately comprising a Stress syndrome prototype reflecting risk for T3D and stroke. A chronic stress and stroke risk phenotype (Stressed) score, independent of age, race or gender, was applied to stratify participants (N = 264; aged 44 \u00b1 9 years) into high stress risk (Stressed, N = 159) and low stress risk (non-Stressed, N = 105) groups. We determined insulin resistance using the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR), which is interchangeable with T3D, and dementia risk markers (cognitive executive functioning (cognitiveexe-func); telomere length; waist circumference (WC), neuronal glia injury; neuron-specific enolase/NSE, S100B). Retinopathy was determined in the mydriatic eye. The Stressed group had greater incidence of HOMA-IR in the upper quartile (\u22655), larger WC, poorer cognitiveexe-func control, shorter telomeres, consistently raised neuronal glia injury, fewer retinal arteries, narrower arteries, wider veins and a larger optic cup/disc ratio (C/D) compared to the non-Stressed group. Furthermore, of the stroke risk markers, arterial narrowing was related to glaucoma risk with a greater C/D, whilst retinal vein widening was related to HOMA-IR, poor cognitiveexe-func control and neuronal glia injury (Adjusted R2 0.30; p \u2264 0.05). These associations were not evident in the non-Stressed group. Logistic regression associations between the Stressed phenotype and four dementia risk markers (cognitiveexe-func, telomere length, NSE and WC) comprised a Stress syndrome prototype (area under the curve 0.80; sensitivity/specificity 85%/58%; p \u2264 0.001). The Stress syndrome prototype reflected risk for HOMA-IR (odds ratio (OR) 7.72) and retinal glia ischemia (OR 1.27) and vein widening (OR 1.03). The Stressed phenotype was associated with neuronal glia injury and retinal ischemia, potentiating glaucoma risk.

Although fermented beverages have been suggested to exert their beneficial effects through their anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, little is known regarding the capacity of beer to modulate innate immunity cell responses. To this aim, primed or activated THP-1 macrophages were conditioned with human serum obtained from a prospective two-arms longitudinal crossover study to investigate the effect of a moderate and regular daily intake of beer, either alcohol-free or traditional, in the regulation of TLR-mediated inflammatory responses in healthy but overweight individuals. Conditioned macrophages with serum obtained after four-week intervention with alcohol-free beer significantly reduced the transcription of pro-inflammatory interleukins such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF. The serum of traditional beer consumers did not exhibit the same capacity as the serum of alcohol-free beer consumers to reduce gene expression of pro-inflammatory interleukins; however, serum from traditional beer consumers showed a regulatory effect at the protein level by significantly decreasing the intracellular protein levels of pro-IL-1\u03b2 in primed macrophages and preventing cleaved-IL-1\u03b2 protein release.</jats:p>",

Bisphenol A (BPA, 4,4\u2032-isopropylidenediphenol) has been identified as an endocrine disruptor. It is ubiquitously detectable in oceans and affects a variety of marine animals. It functions as an estrogen analog and typically causes reproductive toxicity by interfering with the endocrine system. To comparatively analyze the reproductive effects of estradiol (E2) and BPA on sea cucumbers, we identified a G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) in A. japonicus and investigated its effects on reproduction. The results showed that BPA and E2 exposure activated A. japonicus AjGPER1, thereby mediating the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. High-level expression of AjGPER1 in the ovarian tissue was confirmed by qPCR. Furthermore, metabolic changes were induced by 100 nM (22.83 \u03bcg/L) BPA exposure in the ovarian tissue, leading to a notable increase in the activities of trehalase and phosphofructokinase. Overall, our findings suggest that AjGPER1 is directly activated by BPA and affects sea cucumber reproduction by disrupting ovarian tissue metabolism, suggesting that marine pollutants pose a threat to the conservation of sea cucumber resources.</jats:p>",

We hypothesized that stronger damage would occur following exposure under wet conditions. In addition, we checked for the effect of recovery (1 week) after the exposure. Ozone fumigation negatively affected the content of chlorophyll only in wet samples, but in the moss, such a difference was no longer evident after one week of recovery. Photosynthetic efficiency was always impaired by O3 exposure, irrespective of the dry or wet state, and also after one week of recovery, but the effect was much stronger in wet samples. The antioxidant power was increased in wet moss and in dry lichen, while a decrease was found for wet lichens after 1 week. Our results confirm that the tolerance to O3 of lichens and mosses may be determined by their low water content, which is the case during the peaks of O3 occurring during the Mediterranean summer. The role of antioxidant power as a mechanism of resistance to high O3 concentrations needs to be further investigated.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it is crucial to improve diverse strategies to induce the reproductive response in goats during the anestrus stage. The effectiveness of a short P4 + eCG-based estrus induction protocol during both the deep anestrous (March) or the reproductive transition period (June) upon the reproductive performance of crossbred dairy goats was assessed. Adult, anestrous, 24\u201330-month- old dairy crossbred (Saanen\u2013Alpine\u2013Nubian \u00d7 Criollo) goats (n = 123) from two commercial herds and 10 sexually active goat bucks were used. Before the trials, the anestrous status of goats was confirmed. Then, goats were randomly allocated into two different experiments. In Exp. 1, we tested the effect of different doses (D) of intramuscular progesterone (P4; 10 or 20 mg + eCG (100 UI)) and type of breeding (TB), natural mating (NM), or artificial insemination (AI), on two commercial goat herds (H1 &amp; H2), in March (deep anestrous). In Exp. 2, we evaluated the effect of D (P4; 10 or 20 mg + 100 UI eCG) in goats subjected to NM, and either during deep anestrous (March; M) or transitional anestrous (June; J), in two commercial herds. After breeding, conception and pregnancy were diagnosed with ultrasound scanning. The response variables were estrus induction (EI; %), estrus latency (EL; h), ovulation (OVP; %), ovulation rate (OR; units), fertility (FERT; %), and pregnancy (PREG; %). No differences (p &gt; 0.05) in live weight (LW) and body condition score (BCS) occurred between herds in both trials. In Exp. 1, EI, EL, OVP, OR, FERT, and PREG were affected (p &lt; 0.05) by the H\u2013TB\u2013D interaction, whereas in H1 + P4\u201320 combination had the highest (p &lt; 0.05) EI, EL, and OVP values. Irrespective of TB, H1 had the largest (p &lt; 0.05) OR, independently of TB or D. Also, the lowest (p &lt; 0.05) OVP occurred in the AI + P4\u201310 group, while the AI had the lowest (p &lt; 0.05) FERT, irrespective of D. FERT and PREG were two-fold higher (p &lt; 0.05) in NM compared with AI. In Exp. 2, EI, EL, OVP, OR, FERT, and PREG were affected (p &lt; 0.05) by the H\u2013M\u2013D interaction. In general, H2 + P4\u201310 had the lowest (p &lt; 0.05) reproductive outcomes in March, whereas H1 had the largest (p &lt; 0.05) values in either month. No differences (p &gt; 0.05) between P4 doses occurred for EI, OVP, OR, FERT, and PREG. Yet, the largest (p &lt; 0.05) EL occurred with P4\u201320 in June. No correlations (p &gt; 0.05) occurred between LW and all the reproductive variables. BCS was positively correlated (p &lt; 0.05) with EI (0.34), OVP (0.44), OR (0.58), and PREG (0.20). Also, positive correlations (p &lt; 0.05) occurred between EI with EL (0.83), OVP (0.80), OR (0.64), and PREG (0.56); EL with OVP (0.58), OR (0.44), and PREG (0.42); OVP with OR (0.79) and PREG (0.70), as well as OR and PREG (0.63). Results of these studies confirm a multidimensional response regarding the effectiveness of P4 + eCG for estrus induction in goats mainly modulated by a specific time within the anestrous season, or even by specific management or a particular environment at the herd level (H1), although quite remarkably independent of the animal\u2019s LW or BCS at herd level. Moreover, the best reproductive outcomes occurred with NM in June. The most reproductive variables were similar using either 10 or 20 mg P4 + 100 IU eCG, giving the possibility to lessen the scale in the use of exogenous hormones while obtaining acceptable out of season reproductive response.</jats:p>",

Multinomial logit and negative-binomial models were fit to investigate whether the multiple types of SWD and the time to onset of SWD following TBI could be predicted by patient variables. Distributions of SWD diagnosed after TBI were similar between genders. The probability of insomnia increased with increasing patient age. The probability of \u2018difficulty sleeping\u2019 was highest in 7\u20139 year-old TBI patients. Older TBI patients had shorter time to SWD onset than younger patients.

Among available targets, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) shows favorable characteristics mainly because of the lysosome-bypassed pathway of LDL delivery to the brain, allowing an intact discharge of the carried ligand to the brain targets. The phage display technology was employed to identify a dodecapeptide targeted to the extracellular domain of LDLR (ED-LDLR). This peptide was able to bind the ED-LDLR in the presence of natural ligands and dissociated at acidic pH and in the absence of calcium, in a similar manner as the LDL. In vitro, our peptide was endocytosed by endothelial cells through the caveolae-dependent pathway, proper to the LDLR route in BBB, suggesting the prevention of its lysosomal degradation. The in vivo studies performed by magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescent lifetime imaging suggested the brain penetration of this ED-LDLR-targeted peptide.</jats:p>",

However, no approved drug or vaccines are available, and treatment is mainly supportive and through a few repurposed drugs. The urgency of the situation requires the development of SARS-CoV-2-based vaccines. Immunoinformatic and molecular modelling are time-efficient methods that are generally used to accelerate the discovery and design of the candidate peptides for vaccine development. In recent years, the use of multiepitope vaccines has proved to be a promising immunization strategy against viruses and pathogens, thus inducing more comprehensive protective immunity. The current study demonstrated a comprehensive in silico strategy to design stable multiepitope vaccine construct (MVC) from B-cell and T-cell epitopes of essential SARS-CoV-2 proteins with the help of adjuvants and linkers. The integrated molecular dynamics simulations analysis revealed the stability of MVC and its interaction with human Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which trigger an innate and adaptive immune response. Later, the in silico cloning in a known pET28a vector system also estimated the possibility of MVC expression in Escherichia coli. Despite that this study lacks validation of this vaccine construct in terms of its efficacy, the current integrated strategy encompasses the initial multiple epitope vaccine design concepts. After validation, this MVC can be present as a better prophylactic solution against COVID-19.</jats:p>",

Compared to commonly utilized mouse models, companion animals, specifically dogs and cats, share a closer phylogenetical distance, body size, and genome organization. Most importantly, pets develop spontaneous, rather than artificially induced, cancers. The incidence of cancer in people and companion animals is quite similar and cancer is the leading cause of death in dogs over 10 years of age. Many cancer types in dogs and cats have similar pathological, molecular, and clinical features to their human counterparts. Drug toxicity and response to anti-cancer treatment in dogs and cats are also similar to those in people. Companion animals share their lives with their owners, including the environmental and socioeconomic cancer-risk factors. In contrast to humans, pets have a shorter life span and cancer progression is often more rapid. Clinical trials in companion animals are cheaper and less time consuming compared to human trials. Dogs and cats with naturally occurring cancers are an ideal and unique model for human cancer research. Model selection for the specific type of cancer is of pivotal importance. Although companion animal models for translational research have been reviewed previously, this review will try to summarize the most important advantages and disadvantages of this model. Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma as a model for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and canine oral melanoma as a model for mucosal melanoma and immunotherapy in people will be discussed as examples.</jats:p>",

We evaluated the impact of G4s on mRNA levels by RT-qPCR and products of reverse transcription by Southern blot analysis. We found that the presence of G4 inhibited Ty1his3-AI retrotransposition. The effect was stronger when G4s were on a transcription template strand which leads to reverse transcription interruption. Both NMM and Pif1p deficiency reduced the retrotransposition irrespective of the presence of a G4 motif in the Ty1his3-AI element. Quantity of mRNA and products of reverse transcription did not fully explain the impact of G4s on Ty1his3-AI retrotransposition indicating that G4s probably affect some other steps of the retrotransposon life-cycle (e.g., translation, VLP formation, integration).

Biological control through the utilization of microorganisms not only effectively inhibits the disease, but also gives consideration to environmental friendliness. Therefore, investigating an endophytic biological control method for cassava bacterial blight is of great importance. In this study, cassava leaf tissues were used as test specimens in order to isolate endophytic bacteria by using dilution and separation methods. Bacillus ME9, derived from cassava endophytic bacteria, exhibits good antagonism against a diverse range of pathogens, including Xpm11. Its genome consists of a series of genes encoding antibacterial lipopeptides, which may be directly related to its antibacterial capabilities. Furthermore, inoculation resulted in a substantial change in the diversity of the endophytic bacterial community, characterized by improved diversity, and displayed an obvious inhibition of pathogenic bacterial growth, demonstrating successful colonization within plants. The results laid a foundation and provided theoretical support for the development and utilization of cassava endophytic bacterial diversity and endogenous disease control strategies.</jats:p>",

Women who underwent surgery for gynecological malignancies in our institution over a three-year period were included in this study. Permanent section pathology evaluation was used as the gold standard for malignancy evaluation. Total accordance was observed between flow cytometry and pathology evaluation. In total, 21 aneuploid cancers were detected following DNA index calculation. Of these, 20 were hyperploid and 1 was hypoploid. In addition, tumor samples were characterized by a significantly lower percentage of cells in G0/G1, as well as an induced tumor index. The response time for flow cytometry to obtain results was 5\u20136 min per sample. It seems that flow cytometry analyses for intraoperative tumor evaluation can be safely expanded to gynecological malignancies. This is a novel practical approach that has been proven valuable in several tumor types to date, and also seems to be reliable for gynecological malignancies. Intraoperative flow cytometry is expected to be crucial in decisions of lymph node dissection in endometrial cancers, due to its rapid response regarding the tumor invasion of part or all of the myometrial thickness.

We observed that infection of Balb/c mice with P. yoelii I 7XL was lethal, and a rapid increase in dynamics of IL-10 producing B220+CD5+CD1d+ regulatory B cells over the course of infection was observed. However, animals infected with a less virulent strain of the parasite P. yoelii I7XNL attained complete resistance.

Adoptive transfer of regulatory B cells to na\u00efve mice followed by infection results in slow parasite growth and enhancement of survival in P. yoelii 17XL (lethal) infected animals. Adoptively transferred regulatory B cells also resulted in decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IFN-\u03b3) and enhanced production of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10).

However, data about patients with LC undergoing small bowel surgery is lacking. This study aimed to analyze the morbidity and mortality of patients with LC after small bowel surgery in order to determine predictive risk factors for a poor outcome. (2) Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients undergoing small bowel surgery between January 2002 and July 2018 and identified 76 patients with LC. Postoperative complications were analyzed using the classification of Dindo/Clavien (D/C) and further subdivided (hemorrhage, pulmonary complication, wound healing disturbances, renal failure). A total of 38 possible predictive factors underwent univariate and multivariate analyses for different postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality. (3) Results: Postoperative complications [D/C grade \u2265 II] occurred in 90.8% of patients and severe complications (D/C grade \u2265 IIIB) in 53.9% of patients. Nine patients (11.8%) died during the postoperative course. Predictive factors for overall complications were \u201cadditional surgery\u201d (OR 5.3) and \u201cbowel anastomosis\u201d (OR 5.6). For postoperative mortality, we identified the model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (OR 1.3) and portal hypertension (OR 5.8) as predictors. The most common complication was hemorrhage, followed by pulmonary complications, hydropic decompensation, renal failure, and wound healing disturbances. The most common risk factors for those complications were portal hypertension (PH), poor liver function, emergency or additional surgery, ascites, and high ASA score. (4) Conclusions: LC has a devastating influence on patients\u2019 outcomes after small bowel resection. PH, poor liver function, high ASA score, and additional or emergency surgery as well as ascites were significant risk factors for worse outcomes. Therefore, PH should be treated before surgery whenever possible. Expansion of the operation should be avoided whenever possible and in case of at least moderate preoperative ascites, the creation of an anastomotic ostomy should be evaluated to prevent leakages.</jats:p>",

A better insight into how GBM cells interact with TME is an essential step towards comprehending the mechanisms that give rise to resistance to standard treatment, which can help to pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for GBM patients.</jats:p>",

The consequences of this exposure on biological systems are prompting scientists to study the effects on human health. This current study aimed to determine the effects of intermediate frequency (150 kHz) EMR exposure on the vital organs of female Sprague Dawley rats. The EMR group (n = 10 animals) was exposed to a frequency of 150 kHz with an intensity of 65 \u00b1 15 \u03bcW/cm2 for two months. The control group (n = 10 animals) was exposed to an intensity of 35 \u00b1 15 nW/cm2. Haematological, histochemical, gross, and histopathological profiles of all major organs of all animals were then performed using standard procedures. All major organs generally showed no significant detectable effects in either the control or EMR groups. However, gross and histopathological examinations revealed the effects of EMR on the liver and lungs, which showed inflammatory changes without significant biochemical/haematological manifestations. In addition, a significant increase in serum sodium level and a decrease in serum urea level were also observed in the EMR group. It can be concluded that the current frequency and duration of exposure trigger the changes in the liver and lungs but are not sufficient to cause clinical and functional manifestations. Therefore, a long-term exposure study might be helpful to determine the effects of 150 kHz IF EMR on these organs.</jats:p>",

It is a well-identified risk factor for increased mortality due to heightened rates of heart disease, certain cancers, musculoskeletal disorders, and bacterial, protozoan and viral infections. The increasing prevalence of obesity is of concern, as conventional pathogenesis may indeed be increased in obese hosts rather than healthy hosts, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a new disease and we do not have the luxury of cumulative data. Obesity activates the development of gene induced hypoxia and adipogenesis in obese animals. Several factors can influence obesity, for example, stress can increase the body weight by allowing people to consume high amounts of food with a higher propensity to consume palatable food. Obesity is a risk factor for the development of immune-mediated and some inflammatory-mediated diseases, including atherosclerosis and psoriasis, leading to a dampened immune response to infectious agents, leading to weaker post-infection impacts. Moreover, the obese host creates a special microenvironment for disease pathogenesis, marked by persistent low-grade inflammation. Therefore, it is advisable to sustain healthy eating habits by increasing the consumption of various plant-based and low-fat foods to protect our bodies and decrease the risk of infectious diseases, especially COVID-19.</jats:p>",

Tooth movement in irradiated jaws was 30% less than in controls, representing radiation-related damage. Micro-CT, histological, and molecular outcomes of orthodontic tooth movement were studied. Microstructurally, bone parameters (trabecular thickness, bone volume fraction, bone mineral density) were significantly affected by orthodontic force but not by radiation. Histological parameters were influenced only by orthodontic force, especially by an increase in osteoclasts. A molecular study revealed a differential distribution of cells expressing pre-osteoclast markers (RANK+\u2014majority, CD11b+, CD14+\u2014minority), with changes being influenced by orthodontic force (increased CD11b+ and CD14+ cells) and also by radiation (decreased RANK+ cells). The activation status of osteoclasts (TRAP staining) showed an orthodontic-force-related increase, which probably could not fully compensate for the radiation-associated impairment. The overall balance showed that orthodontic force had elicited a substantial microstructural, histological, and functional normalization process in irradiated maxillae but a radiation-induced impact was still conspicuous.

As recent data suggested that intrinsic choroidal neurons (ICN), an intrinsic choroidal autonomic control, may regulate choroidal thickening via release of the vasodilative vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), it was the aim of the study to investigate the level of choroidal VIP (VIPchor) in the presence of an increased atmospheric pressure in a chicken model. Methods: Chicken choroidal whole mounts were exposed to ambient pressure (n = 20) and 40 mm Hg (n = 20) in a PC-controlled, open chamber system for 24 and 72 h, respectively. The VIP concentration was analyzed by ELISA, and the total protein concentration was measured by the BCA assay. Statistical analysis was done using an unpaired two-tailed t-test. Results: The pressurization systems enabled choroidal whole mount pressurization (40 mm Hg) with humidifying, pressure, temperature, and gas exchange. Overall, the VIPchor level concentration was significantly increased at 40 mmHg compared to the ambient pressure (30.09 \u00b1 7.18 pg vs. 20.69 \u00b1 3.24 pg; p &lt; 0.0001). Subgroup analysis yielded a significantly increased VIPchor level at 40 mmHg compared to the ambient pressure after 24 h (28.42 \u00b1 6.03 pg vs. 20.76 \u00b1 4.06 pg; p = 0.005) and 72 h (31.77 \u00b1 7.82 pg vs. 20.61 \u00b1 2.12 pg; p = 0.002), respectively. The VIPchor elevation at 40 mm Hg ranged between 1.37- (24 h) and 1.54-fold (72 h) compared to the ambient pressure. No difference was observed between the VIPchor level at 24 h and 72 h (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: The increase of the total choroidal VIP level, representing the intracellular VIP content, in the presence of an increased ambient pressure argues for a retention of VIP within the neurons, decreasing both vasodilatation and, consequently, choroid thickness. This finding might be a passive or even active function of ICN in the regulation of choroidal thickness, ocular integrity and IOP.</jats:p>",

However, what caused conotoxin divergence remains unclear and may be related to the role of prey shift. Principal component analysis revealed clustering events within diet subgroups indicating peptide sequence similarity patterns based on the prey they subdue. Molecular analyses using multiple sequence alignment and structural element analysis were conducted to observe the events at the molecular level that caused the subgrouping. Three distinct subgroups were identified. Results showed homologous regions and conserved residues within diet subgroups but divergent between other groups. We specified that these structural elements caused subgrouping in alpha conotoxins that may play a role in function specificity. In each diet subgroup, amino acid character, length of intervening amino acids between cysteine residues, and polypeptide length influenced subgrouping. This study provides molecular insights into the role of prey shift, specifically diet preference, in conotoxin divergence.</jats:p>",

Using clinical samples of brain tissue from healthy individuals and GBM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases, several genes related to pathways such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes (CD44, TWIST1, SNAI1, CDH2, FN1, VIM), angiogenesis/migration-related genes (MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, VEGFA), hypoxia-related genes (HIF1A, PLAT), stemness-related genes (SOX2, PROM1, NES, FOS), and genes involved in the Wnt signalling pathway (DKK1, FZD7) were found to be upregulated in brain samples from GBM patients, and the expression of these genes were also enhanced in 3D GBM cells. Additionally, EMT-related genes were upregulated in GBM archetypes (wild-type IDH1R132 ) that historically have poorer treatment responses, with said genes being significant predictors of poorer survival in the TCGA cohort.

This work was a laboratory-scale trial to show the feasibility of using various mineral carriers to create a permeable in situ barrier in cold (10 \u00b0C) aquifers with extremely high nitrogen pollution and inhabited by the Candidatus Scalindua-dominated indigenous anammox community. It has been established that for the removal of ammonium and nitrite in situ due to the predominant contribution of the anammox process, quartz, kaolin clays of the Kantatsky and Kamalinsky deposits, bentonite clay of the Berezovsky deposit, and zeolite of the Kholinsky deposit can be used as components of the permeable barrier. Biofouling of natural loams from a contaminated aquifer can also occur under favorable conditions. It has been suggested that the anammox activity is determined by a number of factors, including the presence of the essential trace elements in the carrier and the surface morphology. However, one of the most important factors is competition with other microbial groups that can develop on the surface of the carrier at a faster rate. For this reason, carriers with a high specific surface area and containing the necessary microelements were overgrown with the most rapidly growing microorganisms. Bioaugmentation with a \u201cwarm\u201d anammox community from a laboratory reactor dominated by Ca.

All individuals collected during each sampling quarter over a period of 15 years were subjected to laboratory-based analysis. In this study, the stock of D. maruadsi and T. japonicus inhabiting the Beibu Gulf was assessed using length-based methods (bootstrapped electronic length frequency analysis (ELEFAN)) to complete stock assessment in different fishery management periods (the division of fisheries management periods was based on China\u2019s input and output in the South China Sea offshore fisheries over 15 years, specifically divided into period I (2006\u20132010), period II (2011\u20132015), and period III (2016\u20132020)). The results showed that the mean body length, dominant body size, and estimated asymptotic length of two CSPFs decreased, whereas their growth coefficient decreased, indicating miniaturization and slower growth, respectively. Estimated exploitation rates and catching body length for two CSPFs indicated that both stocks in the Beibu Gulf were overexploited in period I and moderately exploited after 2011. These stocks were taking a good turn in status in period III, with the exploitation rate much lower than the initial period and reversing the downward trend in catching body length. Furthermore, the variations in the spawning season of the two CSPF stocks and their barely satisfactory expected yield indicated the complexity of the current fishery management in the Beibu Gulf. These results suggest that management measures to reduce fishing pressure may have a positive influence on the biological characteristics of those CSPFs in the Beibu Gulf; however, the stock structure already affected by overfishing will be a huge challenge for the conservation and restoration of fisheries resources in the future. Given that the current stocks of D. maruadsi and T. japonicus in the Beibu Gulf still have low first-capture body length (Lc) and high fishing mortality (F) (compared to F0.1), we identify a need to refine population structure by controlling fishing efforts and increasing catchable size, and more consideration should be given to the local fishery resource status in fisheries management.</jats:p>",

In 20 test sites (Group A), after surgical removal of the mandibular third molar, a resorbable collagen membrane barrier was placed on the distal aspect of the mandibular second molar to cover the post-surgical bone defect.

OHI-S score of most of the patients was observed to be satisfactory. Group A was observed to achieve a statistically significant reduction in PPD, CAL, and ABL gain compared to Group B. The improvements indicated that the use of collagen membrane facilitates early wound stabilization and promotes primary closure of the defect.

Understanding the molecular differences and their different responses to VO between the RV and left ventricle (LV) at the neonatal and highly plastic stages may improve the long-term management of children with HLHS. Methods and Results: A neonatal rat ventricular VO model was established by the creation of a fistula between the inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta on postnatal day 1 (P1) and confirmed by echocardiographic and histopathological analyses. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that some of the major differences between a normal neonatal RV and LV were associated with the thyroid hormone and insulin signaling pathways. Under the influence of VO, the levels of insulin receptors and thyroid hormone receptors were significantly increased in the LV but decreased in the RV. The transcriptomic analysis also demonstrated that under the influence of VO, the top two common enriched pathways between the RV and LV were the insulin and thyroid hormone signaling pathways, whereas the RV-specific enriched pathways were primarily associated with lipid metabolism and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC); further, the LV-specific enriched pathways were primarily associated with nucleic acid metabolism and microRNAs in cancer. Conclusions: Insulin and thyroid hormones may play critical roles in the differences between a neonatal RV and LV as well as their common responses to VO. Regarding the isolated responses to VO, the RV favors an ARVC change and the LV favors a reduction in microRNAs in cancer. The current study suggests that insulin, thyroid hormone, and cancer-associated microRNAs are potential therapeutic targets that should be explored by basic science studies to improve the function of the RV to match that of the LV.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most common primary brain tumor within the adult population. Current therapeutic options are still limited by high rate of recurrences and signalling axes that promote GBM aggressiveness. The contribution of gap junctions (GJs) to tumor growth and progression has been proven by experimental evidence. Concomitantly, tumor microenvironment has received increasing interest as a critical process in dysregulation and homeostatic escape, finding a close link between molecular mechanisms involved in connexin 43 (CX43)-based intercellular communication and tumorigenesis. Moreover, evidence has come to suggest a crucial role of sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling pathway in GBM proliferation, cell fate and differentiation. Herein, we used two human GBM cell lines, modulating SHH signalling and CX43-based intercellular communication in in vitro models using proliferation and migration assays. Our evidence suggests that modulation of the SHH effector smoothened (SMO), by using a known agonist (i.e., purmorphamine) and a known antagonist (i.e., cyclopamine), affects the CX43 expression levels and therefore the related functions. Moreover, SMO activation also increased cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, inhibition of CX43 channels was able to prevent SMO-induced effects. SHH pathway and CX43 interplay acts inducing tumorigenic program and supporting cell migration, likely representing druggable targets to develop new therapeutic strategies for GBM.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Engagement of PRRs in recognition of PAMPs or DAMPs is one of the processes that initiates cellular stress. These sensors are involved in signaling pathways leading to induction of innate immune processes. Signaling initiated by PRRs is associated with the activation of MyD88-dependent signaling pathways and myddosome formation. MyD88 downstream signaling depends upon the context of signaling initiation, the cell (sub)type and the microenvironment of signal initiation. Recognition of PAMPs or DAMPs through PRRs activates the cellular autonomous defence mechanism, which orchestrates the cell responses to resolve specific insults at the single cell level. In general, stressed endoplasmic reticulum is directly linked with the induction of autophagy and initiation of mitochondrial stress. These processes are regulated by the release of Ca2+ from ER stores accepted by mitochondria, which respond through membrane depolarization and the production of reactive oxygen species generating signals leading to inflammasome activation. In parallel, signaling from PRRs initiates the accumulation of misfolded or inappropriately post-translationally modified proteins in the ER and triggers a group of conserved emergency rescue pathways known as unfolded protein response. The cell-autonomous effector mechanisms have evolutionarily ancient roots and were gradually specialized for the defence of specific cell (sub)types. All of these processes are common to the innate immune recognition of microbial pathogens and tumorigenesis as well. PRRs are active in both cases. Downstream are activated signaling pathways initiated by myddosomes, translated by the cellular autonomous defence mechanism, and finalized by inflammasomes.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading cancers that contribute to a large number of deaths throughout the globe. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a tumorigenic protein that is overactivated in several human malignancies including HCC. In the present report, the effect of 3-formylchromone (3FC) on the STAT3 signaling pathway in the HCC model was investigated. 3FC downregulated the constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 and non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as JAK1 and JAK2. It also suppressed the transportation of STAT3 to the nucleus and reduced its DNA-binding ability. Pervanadate treatment overrode the 3FC-triggered STAT3 inhibition, and the profiling of cellular phosphatase expression revealed an increase in SHP-2 levels upon 3FC treatment. The siRNA-driven deletion of SHP-2 led to reinstate STAT3 activation. 3FC downmodulated the levels of various oncogenic proteins and decreased CXCL12-driven cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, 3FC did not exhibit any substantial toxicity, whereas it significantly regressed tumor growth in an orthotopic HCC mouse model and abrogated lung metastasis. Overall, 3FC can function as a potent agent that can display antitumor activity by targeting STAT3 signaling in HCC models.</jats:p>",

Then, indirect calorimetry and food intake (FI) were measured. Finally, Adropin, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and free fatty acids (FFA) were measured. Additionally, the histopathology and gene expression of Enho, ROR\u03b1, and Rev-erb-\u03b1 genes were done. The CL alone elevated the Adropin plasma level and gene expression, increased ROR\u03b1 expression, and decreased the Rev-erb-\u03b1 nuclear receptor expression mainly in the liver and kidney. Besides, CL increased the total energy expenditure (TEE) and decreased the respiratory quotient. WD alone or in combination with the CL reversed gene expression of Enho, ROR\u03b1, and Rev-erb-\u03b1. Combined CL and WD increased the TEE, reduced the food intake, increased the ATGL, and reduced the Adropin level in addition to widespread degenerative changes in the liver, spleen, and renal tissues. The deleterious effects of CL and WD on energy homeostasis may include Adropin with the involvement of the ROR\u03b1 and Rev-erb-\u03b1 nuclear receptors.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>The Pacific whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) is a highly significant species in shrimp aquaculture. In the production of shrimp larvae, noticeable variations in the reproductive capacity among female individuals have been observed. Some females experience slow gonadal development, resulting in the inability to spawn, while others undergo multiple maturations and contribute to the majority of larval supply. Despite numerous studies that have been conducted on the regulatory mechanisms of ovarian development in shrimp, the factors contributing to the differences in reproductive capacity among females remain unclear. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, this study examined the differences in the ovarian characteristics between high and low reproductive bulks at different maturity stages, focusing on the cellular and molecular levels. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the abundance of the endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, mitochondria, and mitochondrial cristae in oocytes of high reproductive bulk was significantly higher than that of the low reproductive bulk in the early stages of ovarian maturation (stages I and II). As the ovaries progressed to late-stage maturation (stages III and IV), differences in the internal structures of oocytes between females with different reproductive capacities gradually diminished. Transcriptome analysis identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the mitochondria between two groups, suggesting that energy production processes might play a crucial role in the observed variations in ovary development. The expression levels of the ETS homology factor (EHF) and PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain containing 9 (PRDM9), which were significantly different between the two groups, were compared using qRT-PCR in individuals at different stages of ovarian maturation. The results showed a significantly higher expression of the EHF gene in the ovaries of high reproductive bulk at the II and IV maturity stages compared to the low reproductive bulk, while almost no expression was detected in the eyestalk tissue of the high reproductive bulk. The PRDM9 gene was exclusively expressed in ovarian tissue, with significantly higher expression in the ovaries of the high reproductive bulk at the four maturity stages compared to the low reproductive bulk. Fluorescence in situ hybridization further compared the expression patterns of EHF and PRDM9 in the ovaries of individuals with different fertility levels, with both genes showing stronger positive signals in the high reproductive bulk at the four ovarian stages. These findings not only contribute to our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in shrimp ovarian development, but also provide valuable insights for the cultivation of new varieties aimed at improving shrimp fecundity.</jats:p>",

We wanted to understand how the mitochondrial proteome has adapted to the loss of this protein. Metabolic pathways that utilise oxygen are most likely to be rearranged in these species. Here, we have defined the mitochondrial proteomes of both the red and white muscle of two different icefish species (Champsocephalus gunnari and Chionodraco rastrospinosus) and compared these with two related red-blooded Notothenioids (Notothenia rossii, Trematomus bernacchii). Liquid Chromatography-Mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to generate and examine the proteomic profiles of the two groups. We recorded a total of 91 differentially expressed proteins in the icefish red muscle mitochondria and 89 in the white muscle mitochondria when compared with the red-blooded related species. The icefish have a relatively higher abundance of proteins involved with Complex V of oxidative phosphorylation, RNA metabolism, and homeostasis, and fewer proteins for striated muscle contraction, haem, iron, creatine, and carbohydrate metabolism. Enrichment analyses showed that many important pathways were different in both red muscle and white muscle, including the citric acid cycle, ribosome machinery and fatty acid degradation. Life in the Antarctic waters poses extra challenges to the organisms that reside within them. Icefish have successfully inhabited this environment and we surmise that species without haemoglobin uniquely maintain their physiology. Our study highlights the mitochondrial protein pathway differences between similar fish species according to their specific tissue oxygenation idiosyncrasies.</jats:p>",

Recently, a hereditary systemic amyloidosis was discovered, caused by a naturally occurring D76N \u03b22m variant, which showed a structure remarkably similar to the wild-type (WT) protein, albeit with decreased thermodynamic stability and increased amyloidogenicity. Here, we investigated the role of the D76N mutation in the amyloid formation of \u03b22m by point mutations affecting the Asp76-Lys41 ion-pair of WT \u03b22m and the charge cluster on Asp38. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, we investigated the conformational stability and partial unfolding of the native state of the variants, as well as their amyloidogenic propensity and the stability of amyloid fibrils under various conditions. Furthermore, we studied the intermolecular interactions of WT and mutant proteins with various binding partners that might have in vivo relevance. We found that, relative to WT \u03b22m, the exceptional amyloidogenicity of the pathogenic D76N \u03b22m variant is realized by the deleterious synergy of diverse effects of destabilized native structure, higher sensitivity to negatively charged amphiphilic molecules (e.g., lipids) and polyphosphate, more effective fibril nucleation, higher conformational stability of fibrils, and elevated affinity for extracellular components, including extracellular matrix proteins.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite intensive research, cancer incidence and mortality continue to rise. Consequently, the necessity to develop effective anti-cancer therapy is apparent. We have recently shown that the gut bacteria of animals living in polluted environments, such as crocodiles, are a potential source of novel anti-tumor molecules. To extend this work to other resilient species, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of gut bacteria of Heterometrus spinifer (a scorpion). Bacteria from the feces and gut were isolated, identified and evaluated for their anti-tumor effects. Bacterial-conditioned media was prepared in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 media, and cytotoxicity and growth inhibitory properties were examined against cervical (HeLa) cancer cells. Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was conducted to establish the identity of the molecules. Eighteen bacteria species from the gut (HSG01-18) and ten bacteria species from feces (HSF01-10) were tested for anti-tumor effects. Bacterial-conditioned media from scorpion gut and feces exhibited significant growth inhibitory effects against HeLa cells of 66.9% and 83.8%, respectively. Microscopic analysis of cancer cells treated with conditioned media HSG12 and HSG16 revealed apoptosis-like effects. HSG12 was identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and HSG16 was identified as Bacillus subtilis. Both conditioned media exhibited 100% growth inhibitory effects versus a selection of cancer cells, comprising cervical, breast and prostate cancer cells. LC\u2013MS indicated the presence of 72 and 38 compounds, detected from HSG12 and HSG16, respectively. Out of these compounds, 47 were successfully identified while the remainder were unidentified and are possibly novel. This study suggests that the fecal and gut microbiota of scorpions might possess molecules with anti-cancer properties, however, further intensive research is needed to assess these expectations.</jats:p>",
